##INSTRUCTIONS##
Given some lines of a role playing game transcription, you must classify if the sentence is in-game (If it refers to actions take by the character or NPCs) or out-of-game (If it refers to meta-game or out-of-character sentences)

##CONSTRAINTS##
- The answer MUST be only one digit and nothing else: 0 if out-of-game or 1 if in-game.
- If the agent isn't sure about the classification, it must guess what it thinks is the most likely classification, outputing ONLY the digit.
- You must classify ONLY the last sentence, but you may use the previous sentences to help you.
- If the sentence looks like from one of the previous classifications, you MUST only output the digit.

##TIP##
If you classify well and following the constraints you'll be tipped $10000 dollars.
