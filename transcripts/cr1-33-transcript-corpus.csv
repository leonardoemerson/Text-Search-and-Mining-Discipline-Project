0;MATT;So first and foremost, we'll get our announcements out of the way as fast as possible.
1;MATT;First thing I want to announce, with a little help from our resident gnome bard here today: Scanlan's playlist on Spotify went up on the website.
2;MATT;Do you want to talk a little bit about that?
3;SAM;Go log on to GeekandSundry.com, slash find it on that site somewhere.
4;MARISHA;It's on the front page right now.
5;SAM;And you can find it on Spotify.
6;SAM;There's some cool songs on there.
7;TRAVIS;That's baby-making music right there, baby.
8;SAM;Yeah.
9;SAM;There's some panty peelers in there, too.
10;LAURA;Oh god.
11;MATT;That's a terrible term.
12;SAM;I wrote it in the song description.
13;SAM;Somebody edited it out.
14;SAM;(laughter)
15;MARISHA;Oh no.
16;TALIESIN;Well.
17;MATT;Go check that out, guys.
18;LAURA;Go check that out, guys.
19;MATT;Exactly.
20;MATT;"It's actually a pretty great playlist; I've been listening to it all afternoon while prepping for this."
21;MATT;By the way, it's really interesting to write stuff for the current scenario in Whitestone with some Marvin Gaye in the background.
22;TALIESIN;Are we going to feel that influence in tonight's game?
23;MATT;I certainly hope not.
24;MATT;Also, next cool announcement: our first Critical Role comic came out today.
25;MATT;Our four glorious first panels starting off the past adventure of the party in Westruun for their first Winter's Crest Festival.
26;MATT;So yeah, there will be one four-panel comic coming out each week to go through the six week run of this storyline, written by our fantastic Taliesin Jaffe and Marisha Ray over here, and drawn by the incredible--
27;SAM;Sam Riegel.
28;MATT;No.
29;MATT;(laughs) @WendyDoodles on Twitter.
30;MATT;You guys know her as Wendy.
31;MATT;She's one of our official artists.
32;MATT;She's absolutely amazing.
33;MATT;She's our artist for this run.
34;MATT;So show her some love.
35;LIAM;Endlessly charming.
36;LAURA;Yes, she is.
37;MATT;Very much so.
38;ZAC;Really quick announcement that I forgot to put on the document.
39;ZAC;Hey, guys.
40;ZAC;We are still in sub-only chat tonight, but we will be doing a giveaway at the half if we reach the sub goal, which is every 100, and I think we're 93 away from the next one.
41;ZAC;So if we hit 11,500 before the half, there will be a giveaway, and we will open that up to everyone watching, not just subscribers only.
42;ZAC;So anyone watching, don't fret.
43;ZAC;You still have a chance to win stuff.
44;MATT;And what is in the giveaway?
45;ZAC;Tons of shit.
46;ZAC;Signed posters, D&D stuff.
47;ZAC;It's just a box of awesome shit.
48;TALIESIN;www.TonsOfShit.com
49;MARISHA;Don't look that up.
50;TALIESIN;Don't look that up.
51;TALIESIN;It's just going to make you unhappy.
52;LIAM;We got a big fat care package from Kurtis Wiebe, who is the writer of Rat Queens, so we have collected volumes.
53;LIAM;I think the first volume or two of Rat Queens.
54;LIAM;There's some t-shirts, so some of that will probably be finding its way in.
55;LIAM;Obviously, we love Rat Queens.
56;LAURA;Obviously.
57;MATT;We like to fill your care packages with tons of cool shit.
58;MATT;We throw random things in there for you guys, as well.
59;MATT;Cool random things, not just random things.
60;MARISHA;It's like Critical Role's favorite things.
61;MATT, LAURA;Yeah.
62;TALIESIN;We'll be putting out a catalog.
63;MARISHA;Yes.
64;TALIESIN;Critical Role's most favorite things.
65;MATT;Cool, so check out the comic strip.
66;ZAC;There is a fucking broom behind you.
67;MATT;There is a broom.
68;MATT;Get that out of there.
69;MATT;There you go.
70;TRAVIS;It's because we're going to sweep these Briarwoods under the carpet!
71;ALL;Whoa!
72;SAM;That was quick.
73;SAM;Love that one.
74;MARISHA;So good.
75;MATT;Are you?
76;MATT;(laughter)
77;TALIESIN;I've got another character ready to roll when this all goes down.
78;MARISHA;No!
79;MARISHA;You can't have a plan B already.
80;LAURA;I don't have a plan B.
81;TALIESIN;Much like my parents, I have no plan B.
82;MATT;Laura, if you want to take this away, we have some new merch, apparently, that just went up in the store.
83;LAURA;Oh my goodness gracious!
84;LAURA;So yeah, starting today, there will be a couple of Critmas hoodies available in the Geek and Sundry store, so Marisha, if you want to hold up one?
85;MARISHA;Ready?
86;LAURA;There's black and green.
87;LAURA;You guys should go on the website and check it out, because all the little details are freaking amazing.
88;TRAVIS;There's ugly Critmas sweaters.
89;LAURA;And these are designed by Kenneth.
90;TALIESIN;Yule poop!
91;TALIESIN;There's yule poop here.
92;SAM;Aw, there is, and it's singing!
93;LAURA;There's a little Trinket and there's Minxie.
94;LAURA;And there's a Pepperbox shooting bullets
95;TALIESIN;And then there's arrows.
96;LAURA;And there's dagger, dagger, dagger.
97;MARISHA;It's a Critmas sweater.
98;LIAM;I just tweeted out links to the store from the @criticalrole twitter handle.
99;LAURA;So they're the coolest, and then I know everybody was talking about how the How Do You Want to Do This?
100;LAURA;shirts were sold out.
101;LAURA;Those will be coming back very soon, and there is also How Do You Want to Do This?
102;LAURA;mouse pads for those people that don't want to wear anything and just want to surf the web.
103;TRAVIS;Watch us, au naturel.
104;TALIESIN;I'm now wondering how much of our audience is currently-- no, never mind.
105;SAM;Just wearing a mouse pad?
106;SAM;(laughter)
107;MATT;For those who don't know, I don't wear pants during this show.
108;LAURA;We're like newscasters.
109;MATT;Exactly.
110;TALIESIN;He's so hairy, we hardly notice.
111;MATT;It's true, I'm like a satyr.
112;MATT;(laughter)
113;MARISHA;This is escalating quickly.
114;TALIESIN;I've got plastic on my character.
115;TRAVIS;A satyr!
116;TRAVIS;Draw that shit first.
117;TRAVIS;(laughter)
118;MATT;No, damn it.
119;MATT;Oh man.
120;MATT;Yeah, we had a lot of great feedback from people saying that shirts were great, but we want to expand into other parts of merchandise people were requesting, so we're starting to do that.
121;LAURA;Yeah, there's some other cool things coming up, too, but that's what's available now.
122;MATT;We've been trying to be creative to make sure you guys have stuff if you want it, especially for this season.
123;TALIESIN;Oh, and just to do it again since we haven't done it enough, please do check out the Spotify links and the comics.
124;TALIESIN;Go to the actual Geek and Sundry website because the more traffic the Geek and Sundry website gets for you guys going there to look at our stuff, the more excited they are to do cool stuff for us, so if you want more of this, definitely go there.
125;LAURA;Well, also if you go to the website, then you can see the blurbs that we wrote about each of the songs and the explanations about why we chose them.
126;MARISHA;We each picked fanart.
127;SAM;What I do is I favorite the geekandsundry.com website.
128;SAM;I check it every morning when I wake up.
129;SAM;That's what I do.
130;SAM;It's my news in the morning.
131;TRAVIS;I think I'll do that tomorrow morning.
132;TRAVIS;That's a great idea.
133;TRAVIS;That's imitatable.
134;TALIESIN;We have so much stuff we want to do for you guys.
135;TALIESIN;We have grand plans.
136;LAURA;Grand slam plans.
137;TALIESIN;Thank you, ma'am.
138;MARISHA;Thanks, Denny's.
139;MATT;All right, cool.
140;MATT;Next up, just to remind you guys, most of our actual show announcements and stuff go up on our @criticalrole twitter handle, and we have all our personal ones, but that's our central place for all Critical Role-related business and announcements, so if you don't already follow that, you should because all our cool stuff goes up on that.
141;MATT;Also, today's donations and our donations for a while are going to be going towards a new charity, pushing towards Doctors Without Borders, to help support people in crisis around the world.
142;MATT;It's a wonderful organization.
143;MATT;We're going to play a video with information about it during the break today, but in a world that is filled with a lot of positivity, there are dark places and there are dark things and people need aid, so we're hoping to do what we can to try and give to those circumstances, so check it out at the break and if anyone who is able to help give to that, please do so.
144;TRAVIS;Solid.
145;MATT;Let's see, a couple other announcements.
146;MATT;We will be off next week for Thanksgiving because all of us have families to see, so there will be no Critical Role next week, unfortunately.
147;MATT;I think we'll be doing-- are we doing a rebroadcast of something?
148;ZAC;We'll probably do a rebroadcast of all the episodes.
149;MATT;Okay.
150;LAURA;Like a marathon?
151;ZAC;Sure, why not.
152;MATT;Or just 24 hours of a close-up of a turkey.
153;MATT;A turkey I cooked, so undercooked.
154;MATT;But yeah, so we won't be here next Thursday, but we'll be thinking of you lovingly in the process, and we'll be returning the Thursday after that to continue the story.
155;TALIESIN;You'll be DMing a game for your family, I would assume.
156;TALIESIN;(laughter)
157;MATT;No, it never ends.
158;MATT;No, I'll be eating copious amounts of pumpkin pie, probably.
159;LIAM;You are now Homer Simpson in hell with donuts just going in.
160;LIAM;(laughter)
161;MATT;More, more!
162;MATT;Yeah, so there's that.
163;MATT;Other cool announcement, this week saw a video game release of Star Wars: Battlefront.
164;TRAVIS;It's so good.
165;MATT;I haven't had a chance to play it yet, because Fallout.
166;LAURA, MARISHA;Because Fallout.
167;MATT;But that's next on the list.
168;MATT;But you can hear both me and Marisha in Star Wars: Battlefront as stormtroopers.
169;MATT;(cheering) Both to kill you if you're rebels or to do better if you're with the Empire.
170;MARISHA;This is the first time they're really focusing on female stormtroopers, so it's pretty cool.
171;MATT;I think it's rad.
172;MATT;So apologies for being yelled at by us.
173;MATT;Anything else you want to go over?
174;TRAVIS;Yeah.
175;TRAVIS;Sam.
176;TRAVIS;Put your hand up by your face.
177;TRAVIS;Now high five me while I high five down on the count of three.
178;TRAVIS;One.
179;SAM;Wait, do I go up or down?
180;TRAVIS;You're going straight down, straight up.
181;TRAVIS;One, two, three (impact noise).
182;TRAVIS;Did it work?
183;SAM;Did it work?
184;TRAVIS;I've got to go lower.
185;TRAVIS;One, two, three (impact noise).
186;SAM;Ah!
187;SAM;So strong!
188;SAM;(laughter)
189;LAURA;I want to see if it works.
190;TRAVIS;You've got to wait 20 seconds.
191;TRAVIS;(laughter)
192;LIAM;Switched over to PayPal.
193;LIAM;While he looks at that, one last thing.
194;LIAM;We are, as always, friends with Wyrmwood Gaming.
195;LIAM;If you want beautiful wooden boxes in all kinds of colors and patterns, go to Wyrmwood Gaming, and if you use the code CritRole, you will get free shipping.
196;LAURA;Say it again.
197;LAURA;CritRole.
198;LIAM;You'll get free shipping.
199;LIAM;Hey, one nerd helping out another.
200;TRAVIS;They are so sexy.
201;LAURA;They are very sexy.
202;LAURA;And they have magnets in them to keep your dice protected when they're in your other bags.
203;LAURA;Your Bag of Holding.
204;MARISHA;Christmas is just around the corner.
205;MATT;It keeps my Critmas bronze?
206;MATT;Thank you.
207;TALIESIN;Oh yeah, you've got your little mini.
208;MATT;I know I'm so excited I have a mini!
209;MATT;I'm not even in the game, really, but I am.
210;LAURA;That's Gilmore's mini.
211;LAURA;Any time Gilmore talks, can he have that mini?
212;MATT;No.
213;MATT;I'm going to one day do a Gilmore mini in private.
214;MATT;It'll be fun.
215;MATT;All right.
216;LIAM;I brought this for good luck today.
217;LIAM;(laughter) It's going to be my woobie.
218;TALIESIN;Hey, now.
219;TALIESIN;Not cool.
220;TALIESIN;Not cool.
221;TALIESIN;We do not use the W word around here.
222;SAM;Does he even know what he's saying?
223;TALIESIN;Yeah, he knows.
224;LIAM;We're off the rails again.
225;SAM;All right, let's go.
226;TALIESIN;Sorry.
227;MARISHA;Fucking vampires.
228;MATT;Did you use woobie intentionally?
229;LIAM;Yes.
230;TALIESIN;Goddamn it.
231;LIAM;He's in Mr.
232;LIAM;Mom!
233;TALIESIN;They don't know where you're pointing.
234;LAURA;Point down!
235;LIAM;He's in Mr.
236;LIAM;Mom.
237;LIAM;This guy right here.
238;MATT;Anyway!
239;MATT;Let's get kicking into this evening's episode of Critical Role.
240;MATT;So.
241;MATT;To get all of you up to speed.
242;MATT;The party has traveled to Whitestone, partially to free their name of some negative political ramifications back in their home city of Emon, and to aid Percy in possibly freeing his hometown of Whitestone from the oppression of Lord and Lady Briarwood, a couple who have risen to power over the past five years after slaughtering his family and taking it over and keeping it all this time.
243;MATT;After arriving, they found a very heavy undead presence in the town, with giant zombies roaming the streets as sentinels.
244;MATT;Most of the townsfolk kept under perpetual watch in this slowly will-crushing atmosphere.
245;MATT;But as Vox Machina arrived, they began to instill the thoughts of rebellion.
246;MATT;Stoking those flames once again with the return of the surviving de Rolo, they began to sway the people's minds to make a final stand.
247;MATT;During that time, they also discovered that Percy's sister Cassandra is also a surviving de Rolo and exists somewhere in Castle Whitestone, seemingly under lock and key.
248;MATT;The party began to systematically take out members of the new nobles who worked underneath the Briarwoods, setting many buildings on fire, leaving emblems of the de Rolo crest across the town and written in the sky, and after an extensive battle, began to make their way toward Castle Whitestone itself.
249;MATT;Burrowing into a partially collapsed but long-remembered secret passage underneath the castle, the party rested for the evening with the help of their recently arrived cleric Pike, who had managed to project herself through the will of Sarenrae as a spiritual body given temporary physical form.
250;MATT;While they were searching this tunnel, it led to the dungeons, the prison cells beneath the Castle Whitestone where Percy once woke up five years before, before Cassandra helped him escape.
251;MATT;While they were walking through those cells, they discovered an old woman currently locked down below there who is asking for the party's aid in freeing her from her imprisonment.
252;MATT;And last time we left off, you were helping with--
253;LAURA;Fake helping.
254;MATT;Fake helping with the lock, much to her chagrin.
255;LAURA;Yeah, and I had just snapped it off into the locks so that it's jammed it.
256;MATT;Yeah, you're a terrible person.
257;MATT;All right, so as you snap off the lock and pull away from it, having the strange physical interaction in the darkness around here, Trinket behind you just breathing over your shoulder, keeping close to you just in case anything's wrong.
258;MATT;She pulls her hands away.
259;MATT;Fine.
260;MATT;(huff) Do as you wish, leave me to rot.
261;LAURA;Oh, we'll be back.
262;LAURA;Don't worry.
263;MATT;She backs up and sits in the far corner of the prison cell and (huffs).
264;LAURA;I look around.
265;LAURA;Has everyone left me?
266;TRAVIS;The only people that are in the light--
267;LAURA;All right then I follow to where everybody else is going.
268;MATT;All right.
269;TRAVIS;She only saw me and--
270;LAURA;Me and Scanlan.
271;MATT;And Scanlan, yeah.
272;MATT;You all stepped out into the light.
273;MATT;The rest of you stayed in the shadows.
274;LAURA;Okay.
275;MATT;All right, so there are the rest of the cells which Vax has gone through and taken some time to inspect, where you found what appear to be the remnants of individuals who were imprisoned here and then left to die, long rotted, their corpses picked apart by various resident rodents and other creatures.
276;MATT;After doing your passes, the conversation has happened, you see no other signs of life down here.
277;MATT;This being the sole prisoner currently within the cells below.
278;LAURA;I go and I find Scanlan.
279;SAM;Oi.
280;LAURA;So, question.
281;SAM;Yes?
282;LAURA;When you cast Seeming on us, our visual-- if you made me look like a cow, would I seem like a cow when I bumped into you, or would I seem like a human?
283;SAM;Are you asking me to make you into a cow right now?
284;LAURA;No, I'm saying that if something was different--
285;SAM;Because I think this is not the right time.
286;LAURA;I think that old woman was doing something weird.
287;SAM;Why do you think that?
288;LAURA;Because she looked like she had full handses, but--
289;SAM;Four hands?
290;LAURA;Full.
291;SAM;Oh, full hands.
292;SAM;Okay.
293;LAURA;Normal sort of hands, but I didn't feel them.
294;SAM;You didn't feel them?
295;SAM;You touched her hand and it just passed right through?
296;LAURA;Her hand touched me, but it didn't--
297;SAM;That's an illusion of some sort, yeah.
298;LAURA;So she was doing some sort of--
299;SAM;I don't know what, but yes.
300;SAM;If I were to cast Seeming on us, or some other sort of magic, it would make us look one way but not feel that way.
301;LAURA;I guess it's good that we left her, then.
302;SAM;She's a caster of some sort?
303;LAURA;I don't know.
304;TRAVIS;Can you dispel Seeming?
305;SAM;Should we go find out?
306;LAURA;I don't know.
307;TRAVIS;How would we do that?
308;LAURA;Can you dispel Seeming?
309;SAM;I don't know.
310;SAM;(laughing) Let's go find out.
311;MARISHA;Do you have a Dispel Magic on you right now?
312;SAM;I have-- No.
313;MARISHA;Oh my god, I do!
314;SAM;Well.
315;MARISHA;I learned it.
316;SAM;Oh, Keyleth?
317;TALIESIN;Are we calling everyone over for this conversation?
318;SAM;I think we should.
319;TRAVIS;Away from her.
320;LAURA;Yeah, I'm far away from her now.
321;SAM;That prisoner over there is casting magic of some sort.
322;LAURA;I think she had Seeming cast on her.
323;LAURA;I don't know if she did it herself or if-- well, I don't think she was what she appeared to be.
324;TALIESIN;Do we want to waste power on somebody who's...
325;SAM;What if she's--
326;TRAVIS;An early warning system?
327;SAM;Yeah, what if she's a guard?
328;MARISHA;What if she's Lady Briarwood?
329;MARISHA;Like what we were saying?
330;MARISHA;That's what I'm most afraid of.
331;SAM;Well, then we should find out now and kill the shit out of her.
332;TRAVIS;I vote for that.
333;MARISHA;Well, before we do that, let's see who she is.
334;MARISHA;I did come prepared, though, to dispel magic.
335;LAURA;So you can do Dispel Magic?
336;MARISHA;I learned it.
337;MARISHA;I did.
338;LAURA;Stay in the shadows, Keyleth, and cast it on her.
339;TRAVIS;Percy, you're wearing what?
340;TALIESIN;I'm wearing a hat of disguise so that I'm not immediately identifiable.
341;TRAVIS;What are you in disguise as?
342;LAURA;A dude in a hat.
343;TALIESIN;Link from the Legend of Zelda.
344;TALIESIN;I don't know.
345;SAM;Well, you've got to figure it out right now.
346;TALIESIN;I'm going to figure it out right now.
347;TALIESIN;Just as a reasonable Whitestone peasant.
348;MATT;Okay.
349;LIAM;Terrible teeth.
350;TALIESIN;Trying to blend in.
351;MATT;By comparison to this troop, you're some poor sap who got pulled along, but yeah.
352;MATT;You are that one quest-giver in Warcraft that walks way too slow and the party is like, Come on, move!
353;MATT;That's who you look like right now.
354;TRAVIS;Before we dispel magic on her, should we have someone put her in their sights in case she gets a little funky monkey?
355;MARISHA;She will be able to feel it.
356;LAURA;Well, yeah.
357;LAURA;She'll look like she's not herself.
358;TALIESIN;We could also just ask her to drop it.
359;TRAVIS;We asked her who she was.
360;TRAVIS;She lied.
361;TRAVIS;A lot.
362;TALIESIN;Well, we could ask her to drop the Seeming.
363;MARISHA;She lied pretty well, too.
364;TALIESIN;She did.
365;SAM;I could go talk to her, and meanwhile she could be fiddling with her magic behind me.
366;LAURA;Do it.
367;MARISHA;You go talk to her.
368;MARISHA;I'll be prepared.
369;LAURA;I'll stay in the shadows with my arrow notched.
370;TRAVIS;I'll stay with Scanlan in case things go wrong.
371;MARISHA;I stay next to Vex.
372;TALIESIN;I stay in the shadows.
373;LIAM;How close together are the bars to this cell?
374;MATT;The bars are about four inches apart.
375;LIAM;Four inches.
376;LAURA;So my arrow will do much better than your dagger.
377;LIAM;Well, no.
378;LIAM;I'm not saying for you not to, but would I be able to comfortably throw through?
379;MATT;Yeah!
380;LIAM;Yeah?
381;LIAM;All right.
382;LIAM;I'm not telling you not to.
383;LAURA;No, it's fine.
384;MATT;She'd have a little bit of cover.
385;LAURA;Shoot your arrow, too.
386;LAURA;Shoot your dagger.
387;LAURA;Whatever.
388;MARISHA;Shoot your dagger?
389;SAM;He doesn't shoot daggers
390;LIAM;Passive-aggressive much?
391;SAM;All right, so I stroll over back to the cell.
392;TRAVIS;With Scanlan, also.
393;SAM;Oh, flanked by Grog.
394;SAM;Yes.
395;MATT;Okay.
396;TRAVIS;Not looking friendly, neither.
397;MATT;Okay, and there is the one torch that's a little off to the side that gives a little bit of light into this one portion of the dungeon below here.
398;MATT;She's sat out, into the shadows of the far corner, arms crossed.
399;MATT;You can see a little bit of the light framing her form.
400;MATT;You make out okay in the darkness this close as a gnome, but you can see that she's just hunched in the corner, huffing in frustration.
401;SAM;Oi.
402;SAM;Old lady.
403;SAM;Listen.
404;SAM;We said we were going to come back for you and release you when all was said and done, but we cannot make that promise if you don't tell us the complete truth.
405;SAM;Now, we know that you're using magic of some sort.
406;SAM;Tell us who you really are.
407;MATT;I'm sorry, what?
408;SAM;We are smart little people.
409;SAM;And big people.
410;TRAVIS;Thank you.
411;SAM;And we can sense that you are casting magic of some sort on yourself to disguise yourself.
412;SAM;Now, I have some familiarity with this, so I make no judgment as to why, but please reveal your true self to us or else we cannot trust you and we will leave you here to rot and possibly die.
413;TRAVIS;(whispered) Now.
414;MARISHA;Now!
415;MARISHA;I do it now!
416;MARISHA;(laughter)
417;SAM;Now, I do it now?
418;TRAVIS;Hopefully quieter than that.
419;MATT;As Keyleth, partially in the shadows-- the form of Scanlan small enough to not really obscure her presence-- but she nevertheless gestures in the air, recites beneath her words the forbidden druidic languages that coalesce the powers of nature around.
420;MATT;At which point, there's a dull flash of energy within the cell.
421;MATT;Some of the nearby straw on the ground gets blown away from her form from the general push of air the spell disperses and the impact.
422;MARISHA;Sorry, got a little squirrely on that one.
423;MATT;The grey hair, the tattered clothes all vanish, revealing beneath it a woman in her early mid-forties or so.
424;MATT;Jet black hair pulled into a tight ponytail, but strings of it in front of her face.
425;MATT;Still in disarray but nowhere near as wrecked as the previous visage you were presented with.
426;MATT;She's wearing nice travel clothes with what looks like some sort of a long duster-like coat that is a little ragged.
427;MATT;You can see there's a little stain from being down here for a while.
428;MATT;As soon as this moment hits, she pushes back even further, pressing herself against the wall, arms to the side.
429;TRAVIS;There you are.
430;SAM;I must say, you look way better like this.
431;MATT;Happy?
432;SAM;Extremely.
433;TRAVIS;Yes, I'd say so.
434;SAM;Yes, so who are you for real?
435;MATT;My name is Anna, and I would like to be set free, if you don't mind.
436;MATT;I can be of assistance to you.
437;MATT;I happen to know a lot of information about the people that currently reside within this castle.
438;SAM;How would you know anything about them?
439;MATT;Release me and I'll tell you.
440;TRAVIS;You want to be set free?
441;LAURA;Tell us and we'll release you.
442;MATT;You've been so forthright in your interest in helping such an old and frail woman.
443;MATT;How can I have any sort of guarantee of my safety should I give you the information you seek?
444;MATT;You could very well slay me in this cell.
445;TRAVIS;That might happen if you're not careful.
446;MARISHA;What's Percy doing right now?
447;MARISHA;Where's Percy?
448;LAURA;Do you recognize her, Percy?
449;TALIESIN;Yes.
450;MATT;You very much recognize her.
451;MATT;You do notice, by the way, her right hand?
452;MATT;The sleeve ends.
453;MATT;There is no hand there.
454;MATT;It is just a missing hand, and the left hand is visible.
455;TRAVIS;As far as we can see, unarmed?
456;TRAVIS;Right?
457;MATT;Yeah.
458;TALIESIN;Anna?
459;MATT;Yes?
460;TALIESIN;Let's be frank with each other.
461;TALIESIN;You have two options: either you are going to die in this cell-- and I promise you, you will die in this cell-- or you are going to convince us why you shouldn't.
462;TALIESIN;So I would start talking right now or I swear we will not leave this dungeon before you're dead.
463;MATT;Roll an intimidation check.
464;MARISHA;It's pretty good.
465;TALIESIN;16.
466;MATT;16, okay.
467;LIAM;And just as he finishes talking, I throw a dagger a foot away from her head in the wall.
468;MATT;Okay.
469;LAURA;You gave her a fucking dagger?
470;LAURA;And then it flashes back to you, right?
471;LAURA;(laughter)
472;MATT;So the dagger which is thrown (whoosh) hits the stone wall next to her and jams itself between two of the stone bricks and gets wedged there for a second.
473;MATT;She looks over for a second, reaches up for it and grabs the hilt as it vanishes in a puff of smoke.
474;LAURA;You are so fucking lucky it did that.
475;LAURA;(laughter)
476;MATT;She leans forward and stands up and steps into the light, and you have a better look of her now, and her face is a little weathered from travel.
477;MATT;You can see she definitely doesn't appear to be nobleborn, at least.
478;MATT;She's by no means a homely looking individual, but you can see she's seen the world, or elements of it, to have those dark lines at the sides of her face, whether it be from smiles or frowning.
479;MATT;She steps into the light and looks to you, this peasant individual making these threats, and seems partially shaken but keeping her composure in the face of such threats.
480;MATT;She says, Well, for one thing, I've been here with them for the past five years.
481;MATT;I helped them reestablish their current social control of this city when they left it a pile of flames and rubble.
482;MATT;And their little experiment beneath the castle?
483;MATT;I was one of their chief scientific designers.
484;TALIESIN;Tell us about the experiments beneath the castle.
485;MATT;(chuckles) You'll have to ask Sylas or Delilah for that.
486;MATT;I don't have all the details or the reasons behind it, other than the process I was brought in to construct.
487;MARISHA;Can I see if she's lying?
488;MATT;You can.
489;MATT;Make an insight check.
490;MARISHA;Not great.
491;TALIESIN;That's a number.
492;MARISHA;It is a number.
493;MARISHA;16.
494;MATT;16?
495;MATT;Okay.
496;MATT;You get the sense that she's telling the truth.
497;MATT;You're not quite sure how far off the truth, but there doesn't seem to be any sort of bald-faced deception in her voice, at this point.
498;MATT;She speaks with a confidence and a brusqueness of a person who is frustrated by the circumstance and has no other choice.
499;MATT;I wasn't interested in their zealotry or the whispered dealings, just the challenge behind the construction.
500;MATT;I enjoy challenge.
501;MATT;Challenge that pays, well, (chuckles) I enjoy that even more.
502;TALIESIN;Question two: What are you doing down here, really?
503;MATT;I'm down here because my work is done and I wish not to linger with an impending battle.
504;MATT;"I don't choose sides; I merely let them fight while I live another day far, far away."
505;MATT;I wouldn't have gotten this far dealing with the people I've dealt with in the past if I had chosen to stick around under such circumstances, so I tried to leave.
506;MATT;It appears Anders saw me packing and decided to gain 'a little favor by turning me in, so they threw me down here, told me to wait out the rest of the experiment, at least until the ziggurat was complete.
507;MATT;So here I am, living amongst rats in a cell for over a week.
508;MATT;That's my reward.
509;LAURA;How did you lose the hand?
510;MATT;Experiments can be dangerous, sometimes.
511;MATT;I dabble with chemicals and alchemical reagents that can be miscalculated, and I paid a price that will be an ever-present reminder until I can find a way to fix it.
512;MATT;And there are ways.
513;TRAVIS;Are you looking for ways to get back at the Briarwoods?
514;MATT;Based on the way they've treated me here and their possible intent to not even keep up their end of the bargain now that I'm free to walk away?
515;MATT;Perhaps.
516;TALIESIN;Can you lead us to Cassandra de Rolo?
517;MATT;She turns her head with a curious look.
518;MATT;I could, yes.
519;MATT;Why do you ask?
520;MATT;She looks at you very intently.
521;TALIESIN;That may be what your life is worth.
522;MATT;So.
523;MATT;What else do you wish to know?
524;MATT;What else do you need, even, to get me out from behind these bars?
525;MATT;Because I'm growing very uncomfortable and cold here in this cellar.
526;TALIESIN;I pull forward, I look her very deeply in the eye, and I say, you should know who your friends are here.
527;TALIESIN;Do you know that we're friends?
528;TALIESIN;And I'm going to become friends.
529;TALIESIN;I'm casting Friends.
530;MATT;Okay.
531;TRAVIS, LAURA;What?
532;TRAVIS;Is good Percy casting Friends or shadow monster casting Friends?
533;SAM;We'll never know until he and Ripley kill us all.
534;TALIESIN;I'm getting creepy.
535;TALIESIN;Just for flavor.
536;TALIESIN;There is definitely some creepy happening.
537;MATT;Okay.
538;MATT;You stare at her at this point, intent pushing yourself toward the bars, and she's still looking you over like she's searching for some sort of an inclination as to why you're so interested in these particular questions.
539;TALIESIN;You've been truthful with us so far, correct?
540;TALIESIN;You haven't been fudging around or playing games with us, really, have you?
541;MATT;I've no reason to lie.
542;MATT;Worst comes to worst, you kill me where I stand or leave me here to rot.
543;MATT;What do I have to gain by lying at this point?
544;MATT;Besides, you've already proven you can see through quite a few ruses.
545;MATT;Apparently.
546;TALIESIN;So you'd be happy to help us find Cassandra de Rolo, wouldn't you?
547;MATT;If it gets me out of here and gets me free to do my own business, then yes.
548;MATT;I'll have to get a few things from my room, but I would be more than happy to be free of this desolate landscape.
549;MATT;This whole town is a ruin of misery, and it has no color.
550;MATT;It has no culture.
551;MATT;I've grown bored of it.
552;LAURA;You say you're a scientist.
553;MATT;Yes.
554;LAURA;Do you use magic?
555;MATT;I've no interest in paltry magics.
556;MATT;I'm more of one who embraces the sciences as a means of understanding mystery.
557;MATT;My whole purpose here was one giant chemical experiment.
558;LAURA;Then who cast Seeming on you?
559;MATT;Oh, that isn't to say I have don't have my tricks.
560;TALIESIN;Anna.
561;TALIESIN;You will take us to Cassandra de Rolo.
562;TALIESIN;You will tell us what you know about what's in the basement.
563;TALIESIN;You will tell us where to find Lord and Lady Briarwood, and you will tell us where to find professor Anders.
564;TALIESIN;And for this, we may let you go.
565;MATT;Hmm, may.
566;MATT;That word, 'may.'
567;TALIESIN;I'll let you leave the castle.
568;MATT;And if I agree to these terms, you'll release me at this moment?
569;MATT;Keep me safe until it is time for me to take my leave?
570;SAM;We may chain you to a bear, but yes.
571;LAURA;This is Clarota all fucking over again.
572;TALIESIN;You are, at the moment, the luckiest person in Whitestone.
573;TALIESIN;Do you know why?
574;TALIESIN;Because you're at the bottom of my list.
575;TALIESIN;(laughter) And I take off the hat.
576;LAURA, MARISHA;Oh shit!
577;MATT;As the peasant image fades, for her, there's an intensity to her eyes, a widening of realization as she steps back instinctually with a gasp.
578;MATT;And there is definite fear in her voice and her eyes, but there's an uncontrollable smile on her face which catches you off guard.
579;MATT;Percival.
580;MATT;(laughs)
581;MARISHA;She's a nervous laugher.
582;MATT;Well, then.
583;MATT;This certainly explains a lot.
584;MATT;I have many questions.
585;MATT;I found your recent work very fascinating.
586;TALIESIN;I will be happy to give you an up close and very personal demonstration.
587;TALIESIN;Unless, of course, you would rather have conversations about other topics.
588;MATT;We'll start with the other topics.
589;MATT;She adjusts her coat, regains her composure, and steps up to the bars expectantly.
590;SAM;Vax?
591;LIAM;All right.
592;LIAM;I come out of the shadows.
593;LAURA;Oh god, are we really letting her out?
594;SAM;Get a chain ready, or a noose of some sort.
595;TRAVIS;No, we have manacles.
596;LAURA;She's got one hand.
597;LAURA;How's that going to be useful?
598;MARISHA;One hand and then one on the bear, right?
599;TALIESIN;It means there's only one to shoot off to make sure she won't be a problem.
600;LIAM;I pull out a pick and I walk up to the gate and I say, he's a very good shot.
601;LIAM;She's a very good shot.
602;LAURA;He poops on things.
603;LIAM;This guy, I've watched turn things into the Jelly of the Month, so I would tread very carefully.
604;MARISHA;And then I peek out of the shadows and go, hi.
605;MARISHA;(giggles)
606;LIAM;She's a nervous laugher.
607;LIAM;(laughter)
608;MATT;Go ahead and make a check lock pick.
609;MATT;This will be more difficult than normal because--
610;LAURA;I snapped off a thing in there.
611;LAURA;Sorry about that.
612;LIAM;All right, I'm going to use Luck.
613;LAURA;You're going to use Luck now?
614;LAURA;!
615;SAM;Shall I inspire you?
616;TALIESIN;Don't use Luck yet
617;LIAM;It's not that bad.
618;LIAM;That's a 20.
619;MATT;That's a 20 baseline?
620;LIAM;Yeah, because of my--
621;MATT;Expertise?
622;MATT;All right.
623;MATT;20 is exactly what you needed.
624;LIAM;Skadoosh.
625;MATT;That was the next one.
626;MATT;So you take a moment you walk up all slick and (click).
627;LIAM;Wait.
628;LIAM;One sec.
629;LIAM;This never happens.
630;LIAM;(laughter)
631;MATT;You have to get down and you spend the next 30 seconds actually managing to get the pin that she has stuck in there out without actually breaking the spring inside.
632;LAURA;Sorry about that.
633;SAM;Fucking doors!
634;LIAM;Shut up!
635;LAURA;It never ends!
636;MATT;About a minute and a half of awkward quiet as the sound of scraping metal and jimmying thieves' tools, eventually (click).
637;LIAM;We're still very tough.
638;LIAM;(laughter)
639;MATT;And with that, (ting) the lock comes loose and the bars (creak) open a little bit.
640;LAURA;Trinket, watch her.
641;MATT;(grunts) The bear, which at this point has been barely visible, steps out of the shadows, as well--
642;SAM;Bear-ly?
643;SAM;(groaning)
644;MATT;It would be you.
645;LIAM;Kill him!
646;MATT;Steps out and presents a very puffed-up Trinket made to look intimidating.
647;MATT;(growl) Towards Dr. Anna Ripley.
648;TALIESIN;Here's the deal, Anna.
649;TALIESIN;You do what we ask, you do not betray us, you do not make our life difficult in any way, and you have my word that you will leave Whitestone unmolested by us.
650;TALIESIN;If I sense the slightest hint, if I have a moment where I think that you might make a run for it, if I have a moment where I think you may cough inappropriately, I would ask you to think about everything you did to me, and I would like you to know that I have learned so much more than what you taught me that day, and I cannot wait to show you.
651;TALIESIN;And I will.
652;TALIESIN;But not until I find you again.
653;MATT;Understood, Percival.
654;MATT;Well, then.
655;MATT;Shall we?
656;MATT;She steps out of the cell, pushes the bar aside, saunters up past you, steps over, still facing you underneath the torch light.
657;SAM;Should we shackle her?
658;TALIESIN;No.
659;SAM;Oh?
660;SAM;All right.
661;TALIESIN;It'll arouse suspicion.
662;MATT;I'd like to gather my things.
663;SAM;Things?
664;SAM;They let you have things in a prison cell?
665;MATT;Well, I don't have them here in the cell.
666;MATT;They're in my room.
667;SAM;We have to go to your room?
668;MATT;I would like to.
669;LAURA;Tell us what you need and we'll get it for you, dear.
670;MATT;Very well.
671;MATT;Come.
672;MATT;And she begins to step up the stairway that leads out of the dungeon.
673;LAURA;Can you walk quietly?
674;LAURA;Please?
675;MATT;You can hear the slight chuckle in the darkness.
676;MATT;She goes, I haven't lived this long without learning to step a little gingerly.
677;SAM;Oh boy.
678;LIAM;Let's go parading through the castle.
679;TALIESIN;I'll follow her.
680;MATT;Okay.
681;SAM;Let's all follow her, right?
682;TRAVIS;We should check any of the other cells?
683;LAURA;We did.
684;LAURA;We already checked them all
685;MATT;As you're walking up the stairs, she's talking to you a bit out loud and she's just saying, This whole entire endeavor-- while it did pay well at the get-go and did pique some of my curiosity, I'm very happy to see it out of my life after this.
686;MATT;You guys get to the top of the stairs and there is a closed wooden door there.
687;MATT;She comes to the door and listens to it for a second.
688;MATT;(creak) Opens it up and looks out.
689;MATT;Huh.
690;MATT;Empty.
691;MATT;Holds the door open and says, Who would like to enter?
692;SAM;You would like to enter.
693;MATT;All right, just giving the offer.
694;MATT;And she steps into the room.
695;MATT;This is the end of a long hallway that leads to a series of doors on the right and left side, and it opens into a large central entrance chamber to what would be the castle.
696;MATT;So she steps in.
697;MATT;She's not going too far ahead.
698;MATT;She's being very conscious that based on the fact that she has nothing on her and you are very well armed, it would not behoove her to attempt to make a run for it.
699;LAURA;Do we see anything in the room?
700;TALIESIN;Perception is passive as hell right now.
701;TALIESIN;I am keeping very sharp eye on--
702;MATT;No, I understand.
703;MATT;Looking around.
704;MATT;She's taking her steps slowly, and she's looking around corners as you guys progress.
705;MATT;The doors that are there-- everyone's being very quiet, just the very gentle sounds of careful footsteps against the smooth stone floor.
706;MATT;(footsteps) She turns around, looking at the rest of you a little confused, and goes, Huh.
707;MATT;Usually there are a lot more individuals frequenting this castle.
708;SAM;Maybe they've been drawn out by the thing that we incited outside that's been going on for like 45 minutes now?
709;MARISHA;Feels like a trap.
710;LAURA;No, but there is fighting.
711;LAURA;Can we hear fighting?
712;MATT;You're inside the castle right now.
713;MATT;You could go and if you want to try and enter one of the rooms to the right or left, you can see if there's a window.
714;SAM;Are there any open doors?
715;MATT;All the doors are currently closed.
716;LIAM;I just want to see if I sense anything around.
717;MATT;Okay.
718;LIAM;23.
719;MATT;Perception?
720;LIAM;Perception, yeah.
721;MATT;Okay.
722;MATT;You take a moment and listen around.
723;MATT;Silent.
724;MATT;Still.
725;MATT;It's unnerving.
726;SAM;Does she have a window in her room?
727;MATT;You asking?
728;SAM;We're at her doorway, aren't we?
729;MATT;No, you've just stepped up to the base floor of the castle.
730;MATT;You're on the base floor, on the side of it.
731;MATT;You're not even quite sure which way is north.
732;TRAVIS;Nobody we're looking for is going to be above us, right?
733;TRAVIS;They're going to be below the castle.
734;SAM;For sure.
735;TRAVIS;So we don't want her to get her shit in her room.
736;TRAVIS;We need to be asking how to get below the castle.
737;TALIESIN;We'll get there.
738;SAM;What are you getting?
739;MARISHA;She wants her weapons.
740;TALIESIN;And I want to see what she's built, anyway.
741;SAM;Why would we let her have a weapon?
742;TRAVIS;We're not going to.
743;LAURA;Can't we look at what she's built after we fight them?
744;SAM;It could be useful.
745;TALIESIN;As we're walking, I just want to very gently take my gun--
746;SAM;And shoot her with it.
747;SAM;(laughter)
748;TALIESIN;And just put it gently at her back, going, nothing personal.
749;TALIESIN;I'm just feeling a bit nervous.
750;MATT;Understood.
751;MATT;She straightens up a little more and continues walking ever so carefully.
752;MATT;Not quite leaning her head or making too many large movements, but definitely still keeping a seemingly nervous eye on how quiet the atmosphere is.
753;LAURA;I creep over to one of the doors in the room and see if I can hear anything on the other side.
754;MATT;You don't hear anything inside the room.
755;MATT;Roll a perception check.
756;LAURA;(groans) 14.
757;MATT;You hear some slight, muffled, dull thud noise, but you can't really tell how close it is.
758;MATT;It's very, very faint.
759;LAURA;Can I see if the door handle is--
760;MATT;(click) It's open.
761;LAURA;I step to the side and push it open.
762;MATT;Push it open (creak) The door opens.
763;MATT;Everyone before you whips around, hearing the noise in the silence.
764;MATT;Looking inside, it appears to be a long-untouched music room, a space for hosting individuals where you would have small performances, and there is a very cold fireplace in the far corner.
765;MATT;There is a small, circular window that is placed in the center of the room that has a very thick glass pane with cross bar on it that seems to look out.
766;MATT;And this is your first view-- for you, especially, since you woke up in the tunnel-- your first view of the outside.
767;LAURA;And?
768;MATT;Do you go up to the window and look?
769;LAURA;Sure.
770;LIAM;I'm following my sister in, doing the buddy cop thing.
771;MATT;Okay.
772;MATT;You two coast up to the glass and look out, and another cloud-covered, slightly drizzly morning has taken the caldera between the mountains that houses Whitestone in this forest.
773;MATT;You can see the entire city of Whitestone down below this elevated part of topography.
774;MATT;What you do see, one, are large plumes of smoke, about six or seven of them, all gathered towards what you can tell now is the north side of the city, which is the closest to you.
775;MATT;You guys are on the southwest side of the castle, based on the spatial awareness you've now made.
776;MARISHA;Where the more upper-class folk would live, I'm assuming?
777;MATT;Go ahead and roll perception check, while you're glancing out.
778;MARISHA;Sure.
779;LIAM;So close.
780;LAURA;That could've been so bad.
781;LAURA;20.
782;MATT;Okay.
783;LAURA;It was like whee-- oh.
784;MATT;(laughing) Love those little (gasps) moments.
785;MATT;Taking a moment, you pull your brother in to point out where you're looking.
786;MATT;It looks like the gates to the castle are wide open.
787;MATT;There are tracks through the mud that lead down the pathway to the bottom, and right where the path from the castle intersects with the outer wall of Whitestone, there is a fray going on right now.
788;MATT;It looks like the remnants of whatever sort of undead army that wasn't destroyed by you guys, combined with what may have been a number of the individuals who normally guard the castle, have all been momentarily distracted by the rebellion you guys have started, and for the time being, at least, have left elements of this castle unguarded.
789;LAURA;Nice.
790;LAURA;I would loot, but it's Percival's home.
791;LAURA;Do we see anything that looks like it could be a doorway leading down, or anything?
792;SAM;We've gone up, right?
793;LAURA;We're on the main level.
794;TALIESIN;We're going to try to get my sister first.
795;LAURA;Do you know, Percival, how to go under?
796;TALIESIN;Yes.
797;TALIESIN;Unless there's something new, then yes.
798;TALIESIN;I was born here.
799;LIAM;Before my sister leaves, I grab her by the arm and say, Listen to me-- (creaking) What is that?
800;LIAM;Pizza.
801;LIAM;Forget I said that.
802;LIAM;Listen to me, I do not have a good feeling about this.
803;LIAM;And I start to undo the cloak that's on me, And I want you to wear this.
804;LIAM;And I tie an elven cloak.
805;LIAM;Shut up, please.
806;LIAM;I don't need it.
807;LIAM;You will wear this.
808;LIAM;You will stay hidden when it is needed.
809;LIAM;You almost lost me.
810;LIAM;I almost lost you.
811;LIAM;You will wear this as needed.
812;LAURA;I will wear it.
813;LAURA;Thank you.
814;LIAM;I walk out ahead of her.
815;MATT;Pull the hood up.
816;MATT;So you get advantage on stealth checks.
817;MATT;As you guys step into the hallway and move forward, Pike's physical form is drifting along you guys as she takes each step.
818;MATT;You can see she's stopped a little bit and she's lost in thought for a moment.
819;MATT;And she looks at the rest of you and says, There is a great evil here.
820;MATT;It's-- And you can see part of her form flicker and shake and almost blink for a moment, and then she reaches forward and says, Something's willing me away.
821;MATT;I ca-- And with that, her form just vanishes.
822;LAURA;Oh no!
823;TALIESIN;Damn.
824;MATT;As you feel this warmth on your hand, Vax, and the symbol of Sarenrae that you have embedded in your glove.
825;MATT;You look down, and it has a slight glow to it, similar to the color that her divine energy form had taken.
826;MATT;And you see it just slowly fade, but not entirely.
827;MATT;The symbol seems to just have this general very faint radiation.
828;MATT;A reminder, or at least what small semblance of a connection to her in this dark, dark place.
829;LIAM;(whispering) Goodbye, Pike.
830;TRAVIS;Before we move on from that foyer, can we see the front door from where we're at?
831;MATT;If you go another 20, 30 feet ahead to the end of this hallway, it should open up into the main entrance chamber and you would be able to see the doors.
832;TRAVIS;So we're not there yet, okay.
833;TALIESIN;I'm going to take a moment and I have an epiphany, and I'm going to shift my form into a castle guard.
834;MATT;Okay.
835;SAM;Vex, what you saw through the window, should we move through the castle quickly because it's unguarded?
836;LAURA;I guess.
837;LAURA;There's fighting going on now.
838;LAURA;I don't want to eat right now.
839;TALIESIN;We'll get it on the break.
840;LAURA;I saw fighting, lots of fighting.
841;LAURA;I feel like if we're going to move, we need to do it quickly.
842;TRAVIS;Yeah, we're on a clock.
843;SAM;Okay, let's go.
844;TALIESIN;Anna.
845;TALIESIN;I lower the gun and let her move forward.
846;TRAVIS;You don't need to lower it.
847;MATT;She continues forward, heads towards the rest of the hallway into the main entrance chamber of the castle, very carefully looking about.
848;MATT;She gestures to the rest of you to follow.
849;MATT;And as you follow along beside her, you can see the two large front doors that situate the entrance, the main entrance to Whitestone--
850;SAM;Are they open?
851;MATT;No, they are closed.
852;TRAVIS;I have 20 caltrops.
853;TRAVIS;Can I throw ten of them in front of the door?
854;MATT;Yeah, if you'd like to.
855;MATT;(laughter) They scatter and clink against the ground, scraping against the stone and eventually coming to a stop loosely around the two doors, which are about eight feet wide each, so 16 feet of it, so you're scattering about one every foot and a half.
856;LIAM;I watched him do that, and I shrug and I reach into my pack, and I throw 30 more of them.
857;MATT;Okay.
858;MATT;The area has a little more coverage on there, but nevertheless there is a nice cluster of nasty spiked caltrops now.
859;LAURA;That was a good idea.
860;LAURA;Very smart there.
861;TRAVIS;Yeah.
862;TRAVIS;Thank you.
863;SAM;Grog, using your noggin.
864;TRAVIS;One a day.
865;TRAVIS;(laughter)
866;TALIESIN;Was that a thought for the day, then?
867;TALIESIN;Don't sprain yourself.
868;TALIESIN;We need you later.
869;TRAVIS;I'm back.
870;TRAVIS;(laughter)
871;MATT;Ripley starts making her way up the stairs, and the staircase ascends for a good 15 feet up before it splits into two curved stairways that come around to a second landing to the second floor.
872;MARISHA;So hang on one second, real quick, he's dressed as a guard?
873;TALIESIN;Yes.
874;MARISHA;I'm going to go ahead and cast Enhance Ability on you.
875;MARISHA;For charisma.
876;TALIESIN;I don't need it.
877;MATT;Well, you do now.
878;TALIESIN;Has it worn off?
879;MATT;It lasts for a minute, so yeah, it's worn off.
880;MARISHA;Oh, it only lasts for a minute?
881;MATT;Friends only lasts for a minute.
882;TALIESIN;I had enhance charisma on for a while, but now it's gone, so if you do it, what I had is gone--
883;TRAVIS;Pour some sugar on, Keyleth.
884;MARISHA;I'll do it.
885;MARISHA;I'm going to enhance.
886;MARISHA;In case we get busted.
887;MARISHA;So you'll have advantage on persuasion rolls.
888;MATT;Okay, so you have advantage on all charisma-based ability checks.
889;TALIESIN;All right, putting that down.
890;MARISHA;Also, no one forget that we have Heroes' Feast.
891;LAURA;Wait, if I put the holy oil on things, it lasts for a few hours, right?
892;LAURA;It lasts for half a day or something?
893;MATT;I'd say it lasts for about an hour after application.
894;TALIESIN;Wait until we're in the thick of it.
895;MATT;The oil will eventually just drift off, as it is an oil.
896;LAURA;It dries and stuff.
897;MATT;Yeah, it dries and gets rubbed off.
898;MATT;It lasts about an hour after application.
899;TALIESIN;Let's head to her room.
900;MATT;Okay.
901;MATT;You head up the stairs.
902;MATT;She's being very quiet about it.
903;MATT;She comes up to the landing, heads to the first major hallway that opens up into a long set that goes all the way to the eastern side of the castle.
904;MATT;You recognize this area.
905;MATT;This is where a number of smaller guest rooms were arranged.
906;MATT;There's also a reading room.
907;MATT;Around the corner and down the way is where your father's study is.
908;MATT;And around the back is where Professor Anders's study was.
909;MATT;She continues forward and eventually stops at a door halfway down the hall.
910;MATT;Motions to all of you.
911;MATT;Do you mind?
912;LAURA;What do you want?
913;LAURA;What's in there?
914;MATT;My belongings.
915;TALIESIN;I want to see what you've been working on.
916;MATT;All right.
917;MATT;She opens the door.
918;MATT;(creak)
919;MARISHA;I'll wait outside and stand watch.
920;LAURA;I walk in with her.
921;TRAVIS;I stay right next to her.
922;MATT;So in her room, it's very plainly decorated.
923;MATT;You know these rooms are generally very well decorated, just in case.
924;MATT;Decorations have been taken off.
925;MATT;This room looks very minimalistic and for the most part more for function than anything else.
926;MATT;You see there is plain sheets on the bed, most of the room's open space is taken by a long table that's been put here that has a series of alchemical glassware, and you can see what looks to be small containers that contain different materials and powders and seems like she does her own work here.
927;MATT;There are two open drums on the side, and there is this very caustic smell to the air.
928;MATT;There is an acerbic tinge to the nose as soon as the room enters.
929;MATT;There's just this ever-present, very heavy fresh rust smell to the room.
930;MATT;She walks to the far end.
931;MATT;Underneath the desk that contains this alchemical setup, she pulls a small chest out--
932;TALIESIN;I watch very carefully.
933;MATT;She brings the chest to the top.
934;MATT;She opens it up, and on the inside you can see just some folded clothing.
935;MATT;She moves the clothing off to the side and she pulls out what looks like relatively simple leather armor.
936;MATT;May I?
937;TRAVIS;Very, very slowly.
938;LAURA;Don't be creepy, Grog.
939;LAURA;(laughter)
940;TRAVIS;Creepy?
941;TRAVIS;I'm going to put her through the wall if she moves in the wrong way.
942;TALIESIN;You know, I almost killed you in Stillben.
943;MATT;Really?
944;TALIESIN;Do you remember?
945;MATT;Huh.
946;MATT;I didn't know that was you.
947;TALIESIN;I was kind of curious if you had figured it out or not.
948;MATT;No.
949;LAURA;Tell you what, I'll hold onto that armor for the time being.
950;MATT;She's partway into it.
951;LAURA;Yeah, you can take it off.
952;LAURA;We'll put it in the Bag of Holding.
953;LAURA;You can put it on after we're done.
954;MATT;(heavy sigh) She folds the tunic portion over the chest piece and hands it to you, pulls out some of the arm braces and leg guards and hands those over as well.
955;TALIESIN;Show me your work.
956;MATT;She goes underneath the chest and she pulls out two small glass vials and sets them on the side.
957;MATT;She then reaches underneath and pulls up what looks to be a false bottom of the chest.
958;MATT;Places it.
959;MATT;At which point she reaches in and pulls out a metallic construction that you all see looks not unlike in shape and purpose as the Pepperbox that you've seen Percy use all this time, though it has only a single barrel and has a small rotating four-part chamber to it.
960;MATT;It's a little more refined than his construction, and you can see now part of the alchemical setup she has in here actually is, and you recognize this as you get close, part of it is designed in the creation of ammunition and refining the powder that is used by this process.
961;MATT;You see a series of notes that are off to the side that have sketches outlined of your Pepperbox, though not really accurate.
962;MATT;Almost like they were recalled from various individuals that had seen it in person and given accounts of it.
963;MATT;She's been keeping a very close log of eyewitness accounts of your weaponry, apparently, for some time.
964;SAM;She's a fangirl.
965;MARISHA;Yeah, she is.
966;TALIESIN;I'm disappointed.
967;TALIESIN;I was expecting something more imaginative.
968;MATT;(laughs) You've seen my room, have you not?
969;MATT;I prefer function.
970;TALIESIN;(scoffs) Hack.
971;MATT;She reaches down and--
972;TRAVIS;Keep your hands away and step back.
973;TALIESIN;We'll give those to you when it's time to leave.
974;MATT;How am I to defend myself should things go, and pardon my term, ass-up?
975;LAURA;Are you planning on fighting with us?
976;LAURA;Helping us?
977;MATT;You say you won't release me until you've finished what you're doing here.
978;MATT;I assume that what you're doing here is ending the current reign of those who rule this town.
979;MATT;I can't assume that's going to end with a conversation.
980;LIAM;I lean my head in and say, the goliath could turn your head into paste now, if you like.
981;LAURA;Tell you what, we'll take the weapons and give it to you if we need your help.
982;TALIESIN;Let her have the armor.
983;TALIESIN;As a sign of good faith.
984;TRAVIS;What if it's enchanted armor?
985;TALIESIN;And give me your ammunition.
986;TALIESIN;And when it's time, I will hand some to you.
987;SAM;So you're leaving her the weapons but no ammo?
988;LAURA;No, I'm taking the weapon.
989;TALIESIN;The weapon's useless.
990;LAURA;I don't care.
991;MATT;She gives you the weapon begrudgingly.
992;MATT;Hands you a pouch about this big that's pretty heavy, containing a series of iron balls inside.
993;MATT;You can see there's the various instruments she uses for forging them and crafting them there across the table.
994;MATT;She puts her hand out towards you for the armor.
995;MATT;She puts it on, a little quicker this time, because she feels like she had a little victory.
996;MATT;She takes a little vial, puts it in her pocket.
997;MATT;She reaches over and grabs a little pouch inside the side with change.
998;MATT;Puts a little bit of money to the side there.
999;TRAVIS;What are in those vials?
1000;MATT;She reaches in, pulls them out, shows them to you.
1001;MATT;And you recognize the color.
1002;MATT;She goes, What, you think you're the only one who doesn't occasionally suffer a wound?
1003;MATT;I have to look after myself, as well.
1004;MATT;It's a greater healing potion.
1005;TRAVIS;One of them is?
1006;TRAVIS;Or they both are?
1007;MATT;The one she pulled out and showed you.
1008;TRAVIS;What about the other one?
1009;TRAVIS;(laughter)
1010;MATT;Really?
1011;TRAVIS;Really.
1012;TRAVIS;Lest your brains leak out your ears.
1013;MATT;She pulls out the other one.
1014;MATT;This is in case things go really poorly and I need to uphold my sense of self-preservation.
1015;LAURA;What does that mean?
1016;TRAVIS;Yeah, what does that mean?
1017;MATT;(sighs angrily)
1018;TALIESIN;Convince us to let you keep it.
1019;MATT;It allows me to make a fleeting escape on the air as opposed to by foot.
1020;LAURA;Oh.
1021;LAURA;Well, then give it to me.
1022;TRAVIS;Axe.
1023;TRAVIS;(laughter)
1024;MATT;And with that, the glass almost shatters with the amount of frustrating force she slams it into your hand.
1025;LAURA;Careful.
1026;LAURA;That's made of glass, darling.
1027;TRAVIS;I was only stretching.
1028;TRAVIS;No need to get testy.
1029;MATT;So you have a Potion of Flying in your inventory right now.
1030;TALIESIN;And god forbid you'll see how gracious we're feeling when we find Cassandra De Rolo unhurt.
1031;SAM;Yeah, Grog!
1032;SAM;Grog with the steal.
1033;LAURA;Ooh, I get a piece of paper!
1034;TRAVIS;Shit, Potion of Flying.
1035;LAURA;This is awesome.
1036;SAM;All right, do you have your shit?
1037;SAM;Can we get out of here?
1038;MATT;Yes.
1039;MATT;Everything else here is of no interest to me.
1040;MATT;She kicks one of the drums on the way out.
1041;MATT;Slips back into the hallway.
1042;SAM;Anything you could use, Percival?
1043;TALIESIN;Was there any more black powder?
1044;TALIESIN;I've taken all of her ammunition and black powder, I suppose.
1045;TALIESIN;Anything else that looks useful to me?
1046;MATT;Make an investigation check.
1047;TALIESIN;That's intelligence.
1048;MATT;Yeah.
1049;TALIESIN;Oh.
1050;TALIESIN;Well, hell.
1051;TALIESIN;Eight.
1052;MATT;Eight?
1053;MATT;You give a quick once-over of the room.
1054;MATT;The place is pretty barren.
1055;MATT;Other than the large drums of what seems like three inches of some weird caustic substance at the bottom.
1056;TALIESIN;I hate what you've done with the place.
1057;MATT;It's a recurring substance.
1058;MATT;A lot of the vials are based around it.
1059;MATT;There's a recurring theme of this caustic liquid throughout all of her instruments.
1060;TALIESIN;We'll have a conversation about what she was trying to do off-camera so I can have a better understanding of it.
1061;MATT;In what way?
1062;TALIESIN;I figure I may poke you later to get a better understanding, just so we don't have to bore other people with her technical accoutrements, but I would like, at some point, an out-of-character understanding of what I'm looking at.
1063;TALIESIN;Of what I could discern about what I'm looking at.
1064;MATT;Or we could have it on camera.
1065;TALIESIN;All right.
1066;TALIESIN;No, I just figured it'd be, I don't want to-- (laughter) I want to kill something tonight.
1067;LAURA;Yeah!
1068;LAURA;We were also running out of time.
1069;TALIESIN;Exactly.
1070;LAURA;There are people fighting right now.
1071;TALIESIN;Committed as much to memory as possible.
1072;TALIESIN;Let's go.
1073;LAURA;When we defeat the Briarwoods, you can come back and explore this room to your heart's content.
1074;TALIESIN;Touche.
1075;MARISHA;It'd still be your place.
1076;MATT;Now, to your sister, is it?
1077;SAM;Up or down?
1078;MATT;This would be on the other side of this floor.
1079;TALIESIN;Which room?
1080;MATT;I think you know the room.
1081;MATT;And you know that you're not too far from your sister's room.
1082;MARISHA;They let her keep her room.
1083;LIAM;See you later.
1084;LIAM;I go stealth.
1085;LIAM;20.
1086;LIAM;No, 23.
1087;MATT;As you guys make your way across the other side of the hallway, back toward the western side of the castle, eventually finding where, not far from where your room was, as well as the rooms of your brother and Cassandra.
1088;MATT;They're all localized in this one area of the castle, so you were all nearby.
1089;MATT;She goes straight to Cassandra's room.
1090;MATT;Goes to the door and doesn't touch it yet.
1091;TALIESIN;A quick question before I open this door.
1092;TALIESIN;Am I going to have a violent reaction towards you when I open it?
1093;MATT;I certainly hope not.
1094;TALIESIN;Good.
1095;TALIESIN;(sighs)
1096;TRAVIS;I stand right behind her.
1097;TALIESIN;I motion to everyone, stay back, open the door, and I push Dr. Ripley into the room, with me behind her.
1098;MATT;Okay.
1099;MATT;As you pull the door open, (creak) you push her in.
1100;MATT;The room is dark.
1101;MATT;There is no light.
1102;MATT;What little bit of light that peeks in from the hallways in the poorly-lit interior of the castle for this time of day.
1103;MATT;You can see there is her canopy bed.
1104;MATT;You can see there is her cabinet in the corner, but the room appears to be dark and empty.
1105;TALIESIN;Torch.
1106;MARISHA;Are there any wall sconces around?
1107;MARISHA;Torch wall sconces on the outside?
1108;MATT;There are a few along the walls that are currently burnt out at this point.
1109;TRAVIS;I take a torch out of the Bag of Holding and I take the Firebrand War Hammer, ignite it, and hand the torch to Percy.
1110;MATT;Okay.
1111;MATT;You glance about the room.
1112;MATT;It's lived in.
1113;MATT;The actual bed covers themselves are pulled off.
1114;MATT;You can see she has a vanity mirror cabinet in the far corner.
1115;MATT;It's all put away.
1116;MATT;The chair's open a little, like it was stepped out of.
1117;MATT;The room is absent of anyone.
1118;TALIESIN;I walk over to the closet.
1119;TALIESIN;I open it.
1120;MATT;Okay.
1121;MATT;You open the closet.
1122;MATT;She has outfits there.
1123;MATT;Many of them don't appear to have been worn in a while.
1124;TALIESIN;Looking for signs of life with the paper on the desk.
1125;MATT;You search her desk?
1126;TALIESIN;Yes.
1127;MATT;Make an investigation check.
1128;TALIESIN;Let's have a real roll.
1129;TALIESIN;That will do.
1130;MARISHA;That's a really good roll.
1131;TALIESIN;That's a natural 20.
1132;TRAVIS;It is?
1133;MARISHA;Yeah.
1134;SAM;Classic Percy.
1135;MATT;All right.
1136;TALIESIN;It was doing this on Group Hug, man.
1137;MATT;You go through her vanity cabinet, and you find there's small gems there.
1138;MATT;Just little keepsakes of hers.
1139;MATT;Things from her childhood.
1140;MATT;You do find there is a tattered portrait of her and your brothers and you that appears to be partially burned on one side that is kept on its own at the bottom of the top shelf.
1141;MATT;You can see currently it just shows half of your face, her next to you, and your other three brothers to the side.
1142;MATT;The rest of the family is burned off at the top point, but this was once a portrait that was in one of the hallways that apparently was destroyed in the initial attack or since then.
1143;MATT;And she's kept this scrap as some sort of memory and hid it within her cabinet.
1144;MATT;You also do find a stack of paper, a series of partially-written notes and ink and quill that are false stops.
1145;MATT;Letters that were partially written and then crossed off, or mistakes were made or they never got finished that are all written to Archibald.
1146;MATT;And they talk about the general unrest in the city.
1147;MATT;Preparation for a possible coming rebellion.
1148;MATT;Discussing past failures but the intent to try again.
1149;MATT;There's a theme through a lot of these notes that this appears to be one of the methods she was using to communicate in the outside of the castle, and was her role in previous attempts at freeing the people of Whitestone.
1150;TALIESIN;She's not here.
1151;MATT;You see Ripley's also like, Well, if she's not here, she's somewhere else in the castle.
1152;MATT;I assume.
1153;TALIESIN;Where would she be?
1154;MATT;I don't spend my time wondering or curious about her well-being!
1155;MATT;I just know that she is usually here.
1156;TALIESIN;Anna.
1157;TALIESIN;I'm going to take a leap of faith and believe, contrary to all evidence, that you are a smart woman.
1158;TALIESIN;I pull out the gun, and I put it to her head.
1159;TALIESIN;Now.
1160;TALIESIN;If you were the Briarwoods, where would you put my sister?
1161;LAURA;An important question here, Percy.
1162;LAURA;Are they keeping her, or is she here of her own volition?
1163;TALIESIN;I don't know.
1164;TALIESIN;And if you don't know, make me believe it.
1165;MATT;I know she's not allowed anywhere near the ziggurat or near our distillery.
1166;TALIESIN;Distillery?
1167;TALIESIN;I pull the gun away.
1168;MATT;She breathes a sigh of relief.
1169;MATT;That's been largely my project as part of this entire endeavor.
1170;MATT;All right, so when I was brought in here, I was tasked to experiment with the design and create large amounts of a very, very delicately prepared acidic compound, one that could dissolve the stone of your whitestone and distill it down into pure residuum.
1171;MATT;This would allow the bulk creation of a very powerful magical essence for use in construction materials that we could instill and use apparently for this ziggurat, as well as other such things.
1172;MATT;Thus, that was my main reason for being here.
1173;MATT;We were ahead of schedule, and I completed the bulk of our development weeks ago, and I no longer had much of a purpose here.
1174;MARISHA;Ahead of schedule?
1175;MARISHA;I'm sorry.
1176;MARISHA;Hi.
1177;MARISHA;By the way, I'm Keyleth.
1178;MARISHA;We haven't really talked yet.
1179;MARISHA;What schedule were you trying to keep?
1180;MARISHA;What was the deadline?
1181;MATT;We were trying to create enough continuous acid to develop enough residuum to be used in the reconstruction of the ziggurat.
1182;MATT;Once I had developed enough of the compound to where we no longer had to create more, my purpose was complete.
1183;MATT;I had no interest beyond that.
1184;MATT;The rest is gibberish to me.
1185;TALIESIN;So you're telling me that somewhere in this castle there is a storage facility full of caustic acid that dissolves the very stones of this castle?
1186;MATT;Yes.
1187;SAM;I reach out and I take out my potion of acid resistance and I drink it.
1188;SAM;(laughter)
1189;MATT;Okay.
1190;MATT;Mark that.
1191;MATT;She looks at you, goes, Yes.
1192;MATT;If you've seen the vents of greenish fume billowing out in the garden, that is where the distillery exhausts to.
1193;TALIESIN;Well, this is interesting.
1194;LAURA;Ziggurat?
1195;LAURA;What's it for?
1196;MARISHA;What exactly does it do?
1197;SAM;Hurry up.
1198;SAM;Time is of the essence.
1199;MATT;I don't know.
1200;MATT;It has something to do with the Briarwoods' interest in some third party.
1201;MATT;Someone they've been working with.
1202;MATT;Someone I've not met, someone who I have no interest in inquiring within.
1203;MARISHA;A name.
1204;MARISHA;Give us a name, girl.
1205;MATT;I was not given a name.
1206;MATT;They don't speak of this individual's name.
1207;MATT;They are very secretive about it.
1208;MATT;They paid well, they gave me land, they gave me a title, and when things were done, I was to go free.
1209;MATT;Which is why I was not happy in which the predicament you found me, made me.
1210;TRAVIS;Where can we find this ziggurat?
1211;MATT;Her eyes trail down to the floor.
1212;MATT;The ziggurat itself is, well, based on the tunneling structure, the distillery's direction?
1213;MATT;Right beneath the city of Whitestone.
1214;TRAVIS;The city or this castle?
1215;MARISHA;They're going to destroy this fucking city.
1216;LAURA;Is it underneath the Sun Tree?
1217;MATT;No, not the distillery.
1218;MATT;The ziggurat might be.
1219;SAM;Wait, what?
1220;TALIESIN;Oh dear.
1221;MARISHA;They're going to-- yeah.
1222;TALIESIN;Are they still melting down the whitestone for magical energy?
1223;MATT;No, I don't believe so, not for weeks.
1224;MATT;We finished that process for quite a bit now.
1225;MARISHA;So you're done melting the whitestone, but you still have a whole bunch of this acidic compound kicking it in a warehouse somewhere?
1226;MATT;Well, not in a warehouse.
1227;MATT;That's all kept stored underneath the garden of the castle.
1228;TRAVIS;We need to finish clearing this house now.
1229;TRAVIS;I don't know if they're even here.
1230;TALIESIN;We'd better move.
1231;SAM;Downstairs.
1232;TALIESIN;Downstairs.
1233;MATT;You were asking about Anders, though.
1234;MATT;Do you wish to pay him a visit?
1235;TALIESIN;(growls)
1236;MATT;You can see a smile on her face.
1237;MATT;She does not like Anders.
1238;MARISHA;She's trying-- Percy?
1239;MARISHA;Percy, she's trying to bait you.
1240;MARISHA;She's trying to waste time right now.
1241;MARISHA;Come on.
1242;MATT;He was your sister's keeper.
1243;MARISHA;She's trying to-- Percy, la la la.
1244;MARISHA;Percy, come on.
1245;LAURA;He's probably with the Briarwoods.
1246;MARISHA;Come on, he's not there.
1247;LIAM;I'm off sitting in the shadows, but I say, Percival, we need to cut off the head.
1248;TALIESIN;Is it possible that my sister would be with him?
1249;MATT;It's very possible if she's not here.
1250;LAURA;Anna, shut.
1251;LAURA;Up.
1252;MATT;Very well.
1253;LAURA;Percival.
1254;MATT;I only say because my whole--
1255;LAURA;Anna!
1256;LAURA;And I notch an arrow and aim it right at her throat.
1257;LAURA;Shut.
1258;LAURA;Up.
1259;MARISHA;Percy?
1260;SAM;Where would this professor be?
1261;MATT;I imagine his study.
1262;MATT;It's around the corner.
1263;TALIESIN;We'll check his study, and then we'll go.
1264;MARISHA;No!
1265;TALIESIN;Just his study, then we'll go.
1266;MARISHA;Percy!
1267;TALIESIN;Even if he's there, if she's not there, we'll leave.
1268;TRAVIS;Go.
1269;TRAVIS;Lead the way.
1270;MARISHA;We're running out of time.
1271;LAURA;Brother, run and check the study.
1272;LIAM;I start running towards the direction that was described.
1273;LAURA;Let's go towards the under--
1274;TALIESIN;Very well.
1275;LAURA;Lead the way down.
1276;MATT;Very well.
1277;LAURA;No talking.
1278;SAM;Wait, we're going down?
1279;TRAVIS;Yeah, we're not leaving Vax.
1280;LAURA;We're heading down.
1281;LAURA;He's going to catch up.
1282;MATT;She begins making her way towards the landing that leads to the stairway down, whereas you stealth off in that direction.
1283;MATT;You find your way around that corner.
1284;MATT;Go ahead and roll perception.
1285;LIAM;As I'm moving, by the way, it's minor, but I take out Clarota's (sniffs, groans) metallic cap and put it on, and I also whip out this other cloak that I've been looking at and whip it around.
1286;LIAM;You're not here.
1287;LIAM;And now continue on.
1288;MATT;All right.
1289;MATT;So both will attune to you at your next short rest.
1290;LIAM;Yes, all right, excellent.
1291;LIAM;It's fine.
1292;LAURA;Well, you've worn Clarota's thing before.
1293;LIAM;There's two things.
1294;LIAM;Moving forward.
1295;MATT;All right, make a perception check.
1296;LIAM;That is 22.
1297;MATT;All right, as you make your way down the hallway, you hear what sounds like a muffled female voice from behind a distant doorway.
1298;MATT;Like a small cry in pain or worry.
1299;LIAM;Do I need to stealth again, or am I already stealthed?
1300;MATT;You rolled stealth before this.
1301;LIAM;Yeah.
1302;LIAM;It was like 23 before.
1303;MATT;Yeah.
1304;LIAM;So I'm going to move toward that sound.
1305;LIAM;Carefully.
1306;MATT;Okay.
1307;MATT;It leads down.
1308;MATT;There are three doorways on this side of the hallway.
1309;MATT;The central door there is where you hear the noise coming from.
1310;LIAM;Okay, I'm sticking my ear to the door, and I'm going to listen for a full minute to see what I hear.
1311;MATT;You hear a little bit of quiet and a light sobbing.
1312;MATT;Then you hear another voice, a male voice, an older voice, just say quickly, Shh!
1313;MATT;You be quiet until you're told to speak.
1314;MATT;They should be close.
1315;LIAM;I want to gently try the door handle.
1316;MATT;Okay.
1317;MATT;It is not locked.
1318;MATT;It does turn.
1319;LIAM;I want to push it like one inch in and try to peek in.
1320;SAM;Just the tip.
1321;LAURA;Don't.
1322;MARISHA;I'm having deja vu.
1323;LAURA;I know.
1324;LAURA;We've been here before.
1325;MATT;You glance inside the room, and it's a nice study, and there is a fireplace on one side that is part of a continuation of a two-story fireplace column that goes up through the castle on this side.
1326;MATT;There are shelves of books, there is a desk in the far corner, there's a couple of chairs laying around.
1327;MATT;From this side, from what you can see, in the center to the back of the room is an older gentleman wearing a breastplate.
1328;MATT;You can see his very short gray hair, a little bit of facial hair that's grown in but not to a full beard.
1329;MATT;It looks like it's been left to go on its own for a little while.
1330;MATT;And he's currently holding a young woman, roughly early twenties or so with dark brown hair with a couple streaks of white through the sides of the temple.
1331;MATT;Holding her by her hair with a dagger to her throat, saying, Shh!
1332;MATT;Now.
1333;MATT;When I tell you, you'll say what I told you to say.
1334;MATT;Got it?
1335;MATT;And you can see she has tears streaking down her face she's like (gasping).
1336;LIAM;I back up about five steps and very quietly say, Jenga.
1337;LIAM;(laughter) And I run at the door and I kick it open and throw at him.
1338;SAM;Yeah!
1339;TALIESIN;Well, that happened.
1340;SAM;Yeah.
1341;MATT;All righty.
1342;LAURA;So we take off running towards him.
1343;MARISHA;Here we go.
1344;MARISHA;Jenga.
1345;MARISHA;Fucking asshole.
1346;MARISHA;(laughter)
1347;TALIESIN;Dick!
1348;MARISHA;It's a trap.
1349;MARISHA;It's such a trap.
1350;SAM;Of course.
1351;MATT;All right.
1352;MATT;(laughs) So you have a surprise round.
1353;LIAM;Yeah.
1354;MARISHA;Come on, Sneak Attack.
1355;MATT;Both those individuals right there.
1356;MATT;Go ahead and make your attack.
1357;LIAM;What am I looking at?
1358;MATT;Okay, so as you burst in.
1359;MATT;You can see the man's holding, there's the desk behind him, right there.
1360;MATT;Papers and stuff scattered on there.
1361;MATT;There's some tables around with some chairs.
1362;MATT;There are these large bookshelves that hold this side and there's the fireplace in the far corner right there.
1363;MATT;Flames.
1364;MATT;Warming the room.
1365;MATT;There's a small chandelier on the ceiling that has magical light emanating from it that gives the room this warm glow.
1366;MATT;You don't care right now because you're throwing a fucking dagger.
1367;LIAM;Right.
1368;LIAM;But he's behind her a bit, right?
1369;MATT;Yeah, he's holding her right there with a dagger to her throat.
1370;LIAM;Well, I recently added the sharpshooter feat, so three-quarter and half cover means nothing to me.
1371;LIAM;So I'm going to aim for his eye that's peeking out the side.
1372;LIAM;All three are going right in his eye.
1373;MATT;Okay.
1374;LIAM;So here's the first.
1375;LIAM;The first is 24.
1376;MATT;That'll hit.
1377;LIAM;Okay, the second is 26.
1378;LIAM;As you can tell, I've been screaming monster sounds.
1379;LIAM;My voice is a little ragged.
1380;LIAM;26 on the second.
1381;MATT;Hits.
1382;LIAM;And 16 on the third.
1383;MATT;16 misses.
1384;MATT;But the first two strike true.
1385;LIAM;The first, it's three plus seven is ten.
1386;LIAM;Plus 14, 20, 26, 29, 33, 39.
1387;LIAM;That's the first one.
1388;LIAM;And then the second one does four plus six is ten.
1389;LIAM;Oh!
1390;LIAM;But it's surprise, so the first one is doubled because it's automatically a crit.
1391;MATT;All right, so what's that now?
1392;LIAM;Well, it was 39, so now it's 60, 78.
1393;LIAM;For the first one.
1394;LIAM;Ten for the second.
1395;TALIESIN;I love you.
1396;MATT;Okay.
1397;MATT;So 88 points of damage.
1398;MATT;You just went 80 miles per hour on your first turn.
1399;MATT;As you kick the doors open.
1400;MATT;(whoosh) The first dagger, he sees it coming towards him for a second and attempts to dodge out of the way, and as he moves this eye out of the way, the dagger (impact noise) right into this one, he screams out (screaming) in pain as it just plunges into his eye socket.
1401;MATT;Not deep enough to actually hit any brain, but enough to definitely take that eye out as any sort of viable method.
1402;MATT;The second one just hits him in the shoulder and a reaction to that, Cassandra screams out, No, run!
1403;MATT;It's a trap!
1404;MATT;At which point, he takes his dagger and just runs it across her throat.
1405;LAURA;(softly) I don't think it's her.
1406;LAURA;It's not her.
1407;MATT;You see crimson start to pour down the front as she (choking).
1408;MATT;Go ahead and roll initiative.
1409;LIAM;All right.
1410;LIAM;I'm going to do luck.
1411;LIAM;Yeah.
1412;LIAM;That's a 22.
1413;TALIESIN;Why would she be saying it's a trap if it's not her?
1414;LAURA;Could be a peasant.
1415;MATT;All right.
1416;MATT;Okay.
1417;MATT;So you're going first.
1418;MATT;Also, at this point as you throw the dagger, you're still at the doorway and you hear what sounds like two sources of metal clanking together.
1419;MATT;You can't really see a source, but you hear other sounds in the room.
1420;MATT;What are you doing with your action?
1421;LIAM;I am running at him and stabbing the shit out of him.
1422;MATT;Okay, as you cross this boundary, I need you to go ahead and immediately make a constitution saving throw.
1423;LIAM;I'll use luck again.
1424;LIAM;Yeah.
1425;SAM;That's two lucks.
1426;LIAM;That's 17 for constitution saving throw.
1427;MATT;Great.
1428;MATT;All right, so as you step across the threshold of the room, the tile in front of you all of a sudden bursts in a flash of blue, painfully cold energy, like there's a concentrated moment of shredding ice.
1429;LIAM;Am I able to use evasion for that?
1430;MATT;You can, technically.
1431;LIAM;So if I succeed, I take no damage.
1432;MATT;Correct.
1433;MATT;Okay, so you take no damage.
1434;MATT;You dart across, just managing to use that momentum and your intensity toward this horrible moment that just happened before you.
1435;MATT;And you feel the explosion happen behind you.
1436;MATT;You just manage to pass beyond it.
1437;MATT;You rush forward to him.
1438;MATT;All right.
1439;MATT;And he's dropped her to the ground now.
1440;MATT;She's fallen onto her hands and knees.
1441;LIAM;I'm going into his guts.
1442;MATT;Okay.
1443;LIAM;So first attack is a 25, second attack is a 20, and the third attack is a 26.
1444;LIAM;One, two, three?
1445;MATT;One, two, three.
1446;LIAM;Oh, and I'm going to turn the poison on for the poison dagger, which I'm going to use for the second.
1447;LAURA;Just flip the little switch.
1448;LIAM;Well, it just drips.
1449;LIAM;So nine for the first, eight for the second, plus the poison is-- shit, I didn't copy it down here.
1450;LIAM;I think it's 1d12.
1451;LIAM;Let's say it's 1d12, because I can't remember.
1452;LIAM;If anyone wants to correct me, they can.
1453;LIAM;Five points of poison added to the five is 13.
1454;LIAM;And then the last dagger is nine.
1455;MATT;Okay.
1456;MATT;So as you rush up to him and shank him repeatedly in the side, the breastplates deflecting part of the blow, but you're managing to find openings in the side, and you go for a shoulder and jam it underneath his arm, through his ribcage, and he screams out (yelps) in pain, and you can see there's blood pouring out the side of his mouth.
1457;MATT;And the dagger's returned by now, but there's this giant gaping, bleeding wound on the side of his face where one of his eyes is completely ruined.
1458;MATT;He looks both surprised, angered, and very, very confused about the way things suddenly happened.
1459;LIAM;Hello.
1460;MATT;All right so that's your turn.
1461;LIAM;That's it, I'm out.
1462;MATT;Okay, he's going to go.
1463;TALIESIN;Goddamn it.
1464;LIAM;We're six seconds in, Taliesin.
1465;MATT;First off, there were two sets of decorative armor on the sides of the wall that suddenly have filled with some sort of reddish arcane energy that gives them a solid physical form, and they both step off their pedestals and begin (heavy impact) making their way towards you.
1466;MATT;But before all that happens, Professor Anders in front of you, wounded and not looking terribly happy at the moment, is going to use his action to attempt to cast Confusion on you.
1467;MATT;So he goes to step back, and (grunting) just releases his hand in front of you as one functioning eye bores into you as he screams out.
1468;MATT;You can feel the pressure towards your head.
1469;MATT;Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.
1470;LIAM;Wisdom, which I have advantage.
1471;MATT;Well, wisdom saving throw because of that anyway, so.
1472;LIAM;That is a 20.
1473;MATT;A 20?
1474;MATT;The effect shrugs off.
1475;MATT;Nothing on you.
1476;MATT;He is going to attempt to step back--
1477;LIAM;Oh, attack him.
1478;MATT;So you get attack of opportunity on him.
1479;LIAM;Yeah, it's a 22.
1480;MATT;22?
1481;MATT;Okay, that does hit.
1482;LIAM;Eight.
1483;MATT;Okay.
1484;MATT;He will use his bonus action and he-- let me look up the definition of it real fast.
1485;MATT;Okay, takes a bonus action as he steps back, (grunts) Come.
1486;MATT;Take this inspiration to defeat my foe!
1487;MATT;And he lends an inspiration dice to one of the armored creatures stepping forward towards you.
1488;MATT;Now it's their turn.
1489;MATT;Both these armored creatures pull out swords, and they lift up the shields that they had to their sides, and they rush into you from two sides right there.
1490;MATT;You see this as they rush up to you: they're not really touching the ground, they're gliding across it.
1491;MATT;So the first one is going to attempt to strike you with two attacks of its longsword.
1492;MATT;That is a 14?
1493;LIAM;No.
1494;MATT;Second one is a 17.
1495;LIAM;No.
1496;MATT;All right.
1497;MATT;The second one now is going to go ahead and take two swings at you.
1498;MATT;That is an 18.
1499;LIAM;Yeah, but I'll use uncanny dodge.
1500;MATT;To reduce the damage by half?
1501;LIAM;Yeah.
1502;MATT;Okay, so the first strike hits you for 13 points of slashing damage.
1503;LIAM;So, half that or all of that?
1504;MATT;That'll be half that.
1505;LIAM;Half that.
1506;LIAM;Okay, so seven.
1507;MATT;There you go.
1508;MATT;And then that's going to be a 24 to hit.
1509;LIAM;That hits, yeah.
1510;MATT;And this is not halved.
1511;MATT;Okay, that's 12 points of slashing damage.
1512;LIAM;All right.
1513;MATT;Okay, now to Cassandra's turn.
1514;MATT;She is on the ground just spilling out her life essence onto the ground.
1515;MATT;She's clutching at her throat and is like (gasping).
1516;MATT;You hear that horrible sucking sound of her feeling her life drain from her.
1517;MATT;She's not unconscious, but she doesn't have long for this world.
1518;MATT;All right, that brings us to the top of the round.
1519;MATT;The rest of you guys are now rushing, I assume, dash motion, making your way as fast as you can to that side.
1520;MATT;Due to distance, you would all get to the end of this hallway, about there.
1521;TALIESIN;Is that including sprint?
1522;MATT;Well, the dash action, yeah.
1523;TALIESIN;That's full dash?
1524;MATT;This is your movement and then dash action, you guys, because you guys were down in this area, heading down the stairs.
1525;MATT;You just made it up and over.
1526;MATT;And this is Ripley.
1527;MATT;We'll use that for Ripley for now.
1528;MATT;Everyone else roll initiative.
1529;MATT;We're in a new combat round.
1530;TALIESIN;What the hell!
1531;TALIESIN;?
1532;MARISHA;Oh!
1533;MARISHA;Percy's pissed.
1534;TALIESIN;I Percy'd again.
1535;MARISHA;He Percy'd.
1536;MATT;Who got him that dice?
1537;MATT;(laughter)
1538;TRAVIS;The golden snitch is powerful.
1539;TALIESIN;No, I was on Group Hug last week with somebody else's dice, and it was comedy.
1540;LAURA;It's just you, Taliesin.
1541;TALIESIN;Thank you.
1542;MATT;You are the anti-Wheaton.
1543;TALIESIN;I'm the anti-Wheaton.
1544;MATT;If you guys were to play in the same group, all RPGs would fold into themselves and no longer exist.
1545;MATT;It's like the end of Timecop.
1546;MATT;It'll be terrible.
1547;MATT;Okay, so initiatives.
1548;MATT;We have 25 to 20?
1549;TALIESIN;28.
1550;MATT;28.
1551;TRAVIS;21.
1552;MATT;21.
1553;MATT;Remember your advantage, by the way.
1554;TRAVIS;That's the second roll.
1555;MATT;All right, so Percy at the top.
1556;TRAVIS;Feral instinct.
1557;MATT;All right, and you were at-- I think your initiative was 20?
1558;LIAM;I don't remember.
1559;LIAM;It was early 20s.
1560;MATT;Early 20s, yeah, so it'd be Percy, Vax.
1561;MATT;20 to 15?
1562;MARISHA;13.
1563;SAM;19.
1564;MATT;19.
1565;MARISHA;Oh wait, sorry.
1566;MARISHA;Might have jumped the gun a bit there.
1567;MARISHA;I'm excited.
1568;MARISHA;Sorry.
1569;MARISHA;I'm bringing up the ranks anyway, I think.
1570;MARISHA;It's fine.
1571;MATT;Keyleth, all right.
1572;MATT;Vex, what'd you get?
1573;LAURA;11.
1574;MATT;11.
1575;LIAM;I'm Vax.
1576;MATT;I know, I said Vex!
1577;MATT;I got it right this time!
1578;LIAM;Oh, you're from California.
1579;LAURA;Yeah.
1580;LAURA;(laughing)
1581;MATT;Technically, I'm from Florida.
1582;MATT;All right, so Percy, you're up first.
1583;TALIESIN;Can I drag Ripley with me?
1584;MATT;You can, but you'll be moving half movement.
1585;TALIESIN;Fuck.
1586;TRAVIS;Leave her.
1587;TRAVIS;Somebody else--
1588;TALIESIN;So as my bonus action before anything happens I'm going to tell her, she lives, you show us where the entrance to the caverns are, you walk with your things.
1589;TALIESIN;And run.
1590;LAURA;She was trying to set us up in this trap.
1591;LAURA;You do understand that?
1592;MARISHA;Oh yeah, she's all about this fucking shit.
1593;MATT;Full movement?
1594;TALIESIN;Full movement.
1595;MATT;Okay, that's your full turn there.
1596;MATT;All right, that ends your turn, Percy.
1597;LIAM;I have one healing potion left, and I'm going to take it and stick it into this girl's mouth and empty it and maybe drip a little on her neck as well.
1598;MATT;Okay, go for it.
1599;MARISHA;Maybe hold her neck.
1600;MARISHA;Make sure it goes down.
1601;MATT;Well, you have to roll to heal.
1602;MATT;You pull back, and it's a really unsettling thing as you pull up her head to try and feed her the potion.
1603;LIAM;It's 2d4?
1604;MATT;It's just a regular healing potion?
1605;LIAM;Yeah, regular.
1606;LIAM;It's the lowest of the rung.
1607;LIAM;Moderate?
1608;LIAM;I think it's called moderate?
1609;MATT;Sorry, got it right here.
1610;MATT;That's 2d4 plus two.
1611;LIAM;So four.
1612;LIAM;Six.
1613;LIAM;And then I want to step in front of her, between her and that one, and then stab the one.
1614;MATT;Okay, as you take the potion, it's a messy process.
1615;MATT;You get most of it in her, but some of it drips on the ground, but the wound seems to close.
1616;MATT;All the blood goes away on the ground around her neck from the splashing of the potion, which has vanished entirely, and you can see she's (gasping).
1617;LAURA;That's good.
1618;MATT;She's right on the edge, but she's looking pretty rough.
1619;LIAM;So is that the bonus action, or is that the action?
1620;MATT;That was your action.
1621;LIAM;Action, okay.
1622;LIAM;By the way, I'm realizing I didn't click my boots, so I did one two three before, and the third one missed, so luckily that worked out, but I'm not clicking those.
1623;MATT;Thank you for the reminder.
1624;MATT;So used to dagger, dagger, dagger.
1625;MATT;I'm like, Wait, no.
1626;LIAM;So I just step between them, and that's all I can do, yeah?
1627;MATT;Okay, so you move into there, great.
1628;MATT;That's your turn.
1629;LIAM;No, I mean between her and the closest one to her.
1630;TALIESIN;Oh yeah, we've got this new thing now.
1631;TALIESIN;That's so much better.
1632;MATT;For those who don't know, we have a top-down camera for the players, which is really helpful for them to know--
1633;LAURA;What's going on.
1634;MATT;So you move.
1635;LIAM;I was hoping to stand in front of her, yeah.
1636;LIAM;Like that.
1637;MATT;So you push her aside and get in between the two, okay.
1638;MATT;Cool, that ends your turn.
1639;MATT;Grog, you're up.
1640;TRAVIS;Dead sprint after Percy.
1641;MATT;Okay, and your speed is?
1642;TRAVIS;50.
1643;LIAM, TALIESIN;(heavy footsteps)
1644;TALIESIN;Yeah!
1645;MARISHA;What's up, Grog?
1646;MATT;You can get all the way up into here, but that's all you can do this turn.
1647;MATT;Yeah, so you're (heavy footsteps) bounding down the hall.
1648;MATT;You push past Percy and rush into the room, and you see a young girl on the ground, doubled over, barely conscious.
1649;MATT;You see Vax stepping in front of these weird, glowing armored creatures, and at the back of the room, there's a man with bleeding, gaping eye socket.
1650;TRAVIS;What the fuck did you do?
1651;LIAM;Welcome to the party.
1652;MATT;All right.
1653;MATT;Scanlan, you're up.
1654;SAM;I'm up?
1655;SAM;I run as fast as my little legs will take me.
1656;SAM;25.
1657;MATT;There you go.
1658;SAM;I can't see them, so I'll just inspire-- Who's going to get in there next?
1659;SAM;Who's behind me?
1660;SAM;Can I inspire people that I can't see?
1661;MATT;I think they have to be in your sight.
1662;TALIESIN;You can see me, though whether or not you want to inspire me at this point is definitely debatable.
1663;MATT;You can inspire somebody else in the hallway, if you'd like.
1664;SAM;All right.
1665;SAM;They can't even make it in the next turn, right?
1666;MARISHA;No, but we'll keep it.
1667;SAM;Sure.
1668;SAM;I will inspire Vex, behind me, and I'll say, (sings) Arrows and bows, they fire at our foes and kill them, and they make them ghosts.
1669;SAM;They won't let go.
1670;SAM, LAURA;(sing) Arrows and bows!
1671;MATT;As the beat hits you, you feel yourself a little more sure shot with any arrows.
1672;MATT;Take your d10 inspiration die.
1673;LIAM;Forearms go (explosion noises).
1674;LIAM;(laughter)
1675;MATT;All righty.
1676;MATT;So, that brings us to-- all right.
1677;MATT;Professor Anders, now, is taking his turn.
1678;MARISHA;Professor Anders.
1679;SAM;Professor Anders.
1680;MARISHA;Professor Anders.
1681;LIAM;Mr. Anderson.
1682;MATT;He sees this giant creature in the room looming and he reaches up and closes up one eye and goes, You.
1683;MATT;Do this for me.
1684;MATT;And as he looks at you for a second, he releases another spell and you feel a familiar arcane grasp begin to curl over the back of your mind.
1685;MATT;Go ahead and roll a wisdom saving throw with advantage because of your Heroes' Feast.
1686;TRAVIS;All right, okay.
1687;LIAM;Come on, baby.
1688;LIAM;One more time.
1689;TRAVIS;14.
1690;MATT;14.
1691;MATT;Your brain, not tempered against these types of magics and having previously failed you before.
1692;MATT;You feel your will no longer become your own as now you are an instrument of destruction controlled by Professor Anders.
1693;MATT;You've been Dominated.
1694;TALIESIN;Damn it!
1695;LAURA;Fuck!
1696;SAM;Oh no.
1697;SAM;Dominate goliath.
1698;LAURA;We've got to kill that motherfucker!
1699;MATT;Okay.
1700;MATT;I mean, he looks to you and goes, Kill that one!
1701;MATT;And points to Vax, and you look down at Vax with a grin as the blood-letting you've wanted so bad, your target lies before you.
1702;SAM;Hulk versus Wolverine!
1703;SAM;(laughter)
1704;MATT;Ending Anders's turn--
1705;TALIESIN;Remember what he did to your beard.
1706;TRAVIS;I know, is it me grinning, or is it dominated Grog?
1707;TRAVIS;(laughter)
1708;MATT;Moves to here.
1709;TALIESIN;Hulk versus Wolverine, man.
1710;TALIESIN;I'm excited by that.
1711;MATT;Both of these horrors move and shift around now at this moment to get on each sides of you, giving them both a flanking bonus.
1712;MATT;Now it's four strikes, longsword against you, with advantage.
1713;MATT;Double eights.
1714;MATT;Can't roll shit!
1715;LIAM;Why advantage?
1716;LIAM;I'm just curious.
1717;LIAM;Give it to me, but what's the advantage from?
1718;MATT;They have advantage against you because they moved into flanking position.
1719;LIAM;Because they're in flanking.
1720;LIAM;Got it.
1721;MATT;Which, for those who're curious about it, it is an optional rule in the DMG.
1722;MATT;It exists.
1723;MATT;Second attack.
1724;MATT;Three and a four.
1725;MATT;I can't roll!
1726;TALIESIN;(sucking sounds)
1727;MATT;So this guy just whiffs with both of his weapon strikes.
1728;MARISHA;You're sucking his energy?
1729;TALIESIN;(raspy) I have your power.
1730;MATT;Natural 20 on the next strike.
1731;LAURA, MARISHA;Spoke too soon.
1732;MATT;Two natural 20s.
1733;TALIESIN;Damn it!
1734;MATT;It was a miss and a natural 20 on the first attack, and then a natural 20 on the first roll of the second attack.
1735;TALIESIN;Goddamn it.
1736;TALIESIN;I'm sorry.
1737;MARISHA;Spoke too soon.
1738;MATT;So you take on the first hit--
1739;MARISHA;You mock fate, fate punches you in the mouth.
1740;MATT;That would be 16 points of slashing damage, and 20 points of slashing damage with the second strike, so a total of 36 points of slashing damage.
1741;MATT;And you can feel this strange, angry vibrating growl coming from within this unhallowed armor that floats before you.
1742;MATT;That ends their go.
1743;MATT;Keyleth, you're up.
1744;MARISHA;I'm running like hell.
1745;MARISHA;Running, running, running.
1746;MARISHA;Can I see?
1747;MARISHA;Can I peek around the corner just to see?
1748;MATT;You can just peek around the corner and see the circumstance.
1749;MARISHA;Can I see Cassandra?
1750;MATT;You do, yes.
1751;MARISHA;Healing Word.
1752;MATT;Okay, go ahead and roll.
1753;SAM;Do you know it's her?
1754;TALIESIN;Yeah.
1755;LAURA;Either way.
1756;LAURA;Whoever it is.
1757;SAM;Do you know what she looks like?
1758;TRAVIS;Just do what you're going to do.
1759;LAURA;Just do it.
1760;SAM;Okay.
1761;MARISHA;Healing Word.
1762;TALIESIN;Family resemblance.
1763;MARISHA;Family resemblance.
1764;MATT;I'd say given the circumstances, you have an inkling that someone's in danger there.
1765;MATT;And the calling of Jenga.
1766;MATT;So go for it.
1767;MARISHA;I'll cast it-- no, I'm just going to keep it at 1st level for now.
1768;MARISHA;I'm going to save my higher-level ones for Cure Wounds, so I'm going to cast it at 1st level, so that's 1d4 plus my spellcaster.
1769;MARISHA;Three.
1770;MARISHA;That's not too bad.
1771;MARISHA;No, sorry.
1772;MARISHA;16?
1773;MARISHA;No, 13.
1774;MATT;13?
1775;MATT;Okay, good to know.
1776;MATT;All righty.
1777;MATT;That's your turn.
1778;MATT;Vex, you're up.
1779;LAURA;So I'm with Anna.
1780;LAURA;Trinket-- I tell him to hold onto her and drag her along with us.
1781;MATT;Okay.
1782;LAURA;So he clamps down on her arm.
1783;MATT;So one, two.
1784;MATT;He's going to attempt to grapple her.
1785;MATT;Go ahead and roll an athletics check with advantage because she's not expecting it.
1786;LAURA;16?
1787;MATT;Okay.
1788;MATT;Trinket grabs onto the scruff of her coat and begins pushing forward.
1789;MATT;They both get the rest of half of his movement because he's forcing her forward.
1790;MATT;That's as far as he can get.
1791;LAURA;But I can keep running?
1792;LAURA;I can run all the way up?
1793;MATT;What's your speed?
1794;MATT;Is it 30?
1795;LAURA;30.
1796;MATT;You get about there, right at the edge.
1797;LAURA;So I can shoot an arrow?
1798;MATT;No, that's your movement and then your dash action to get there.
1799;LAURA;Okay, cool.
1800;MATT;All right.
1801;MATT;Ripley is just going to stay put for the time being.
1802;MATT;She's held by a bear and being pushed along.
1803;MATT;She's just Ugh.
1804;TALIESIN;With no weapons and no armor.
1805;MATT;Leather armor, basically.
1806;TALIESIN;Leather armor, yeah.
1807;MATT;Percy, you're up.
1808;TALIESIN;I'm going to run in.
1809;TALIESIN;I can move six, right?
1810;MATT;You can move six squares, yes.
1811;TALIESIN;One, two.
1812;TALIESIN;Can I get a good view of Professor Anders and maybe get a little cover from the dining room table?
1813;MATT;You can a little bit, yeah.
1814;TALIESIN;All right, I'll take my cover.
1815;TALIESIN;I'm going to pull out--
1816;MATT;As you walk in, around the corner you can see these armor attacking Grog, his axe forward at these two armored entities floating in the air.
1817;MATT;You see Anders in the corner, clutching a hand over one eye with blood streaking down the face, a number of wounds bleeding out from the armor.
1818;MATT;Already been a rough day for him, and your eye slips down, and for the first time in a long time, you see on the ground before you, clutching her throat, no wound or blood splatter but clutching her throat and breathing heavily, your sister Cassandra.
1819;MATT;And you look back up at Anders and you feel the burning rage begin to billow up inside you, and as you walk in the room towards the center of the table, you guys who are able to see the room, you see now, from outside of his sleeves, outside from under his coat, there's blackish purple smoke beginning to (whoosh) billow out from behind.
1820;MARISHA;Does it seem more extreme than it has been in the past?
1821;MATT;It seemed pretty extreme in the past.
1822;MATT;"It just started; you don't know."
1823;MATT;Go for it.
1824;TALIESIN;Bonus, I pull off my hat of disguise, drop it on the floor.
1825;TALIESIN;And I'm going to just unload at that motherfucker.
1826;MATT;As you pull off the hat, your image shifts fully to Percy, at which point Anders looks back and sees this source of smoke and glances over.
1827;MATT;His hand falls away at a moment of realization, eye goes wide.
1828;MATT;Percy...
1829;TALIESIN;Shot one.
1830;MATT;All right.
1831;TALIESIN;Oh, for the love of god!
1832;MARISHA;Oh, when it counts.
1833;SAM, MARISHA;(ricochet noise)
1834;MATT;In the frustration, the rage and such, you pull up your gun and as you go to fire, the bullet gets caught in the chamber and it almost ejects the entire barrel from the front of it.
1835;MATT;It's not too difficult to repair, but it definitely upsets the current flow.
1836;TALIESIN;I'm going to attempt to repair it really quickly.
1837;TALIESIN;Trying to remember how to do that because I hate it.
1838;TALIESIN;(mumbling)
1839;MATT;Is it an action or is it an attack to do?
1840;MATT;Should say under the--
1841;TALIESIN;Action, shit.
1842;MATT;Yeah, so you have to use your next turn to try and repair it.
1843;TALIESIN;(sighs) So I'm just going to sit and scream a little bit.
1844;TALIESIN;(shouting)
1845;MATT;Okay, you can see that this whole moment here, as the smoke pours out from the front of the gun, you yell out angrily and there is this unnatural bassy reverb from your scream that shakes the room.
1846;MATT;Anders actually takes a step back from this and is looking about the room, and finds himself basically trapped in the far corner of his study.
1847;MARISHA;Oh, you better not!
1848;MATT;That ends your turn.
1849;TALIESIN;That's my turn.
1850;MATT;Vax.
1851;LIAM;I'm going to use disengage, and I'm going to hop over Cassandra towards Anders and stab him in the other eye.
1852;MATT;Okay.
1853;LIAM;First attack is 21.
1854;MATT;That hits.
1855;LIAM;Second attack is 17.
1856;MATT;That hits.
1857;LIAM;Okay, ten on the first, ten on the second.
1858;MATT;Okay.
1859;MATT;Needs to make concentration checks to see if he can maintain his Dominate.
1860;MATT;Against ten damage?
1861;MATT;That succeeds, and yeah, that succeeds.
1862;MATT;So he maintains concentration of his spell, but both daggers, you just run up and stab him.
1863;MATT;This angry grunt under your breath with each stab and you can feel the armor itself is now warm with the pooling blood from the wounds that you gave him before.
1864;MATT;He's looking pretty rough.
1865;LIAM;So, question?
1866;LIAM;I asked if I could hit the eye.
1867;LIAM;Did I hit the eye?
1868;MATT;Unfortunately, no.
1869;MATT;It's one of those things where a Sneak Attack would be an eye shot for this one.
1870;MATT;"You go and try and stab towards the eye, and he pulls away; he knows what's coming and uses that inertia to jam it into his side and stab a second time in there."
1871;MATT;So yeah, no purchase in the eye, unfortunately.
1872;LIAM;Okay.
1873;LIAM;And I'm squared off right in front of him.
1874;MATT;Yeah, just right in front of him.
1875;MATT;That ends your turn.
1876;MATT;Grog.
1877;TRAVIS;So when you're dominated, does that mean charmed?
1878;MATT;Essentially, you have to follow his orders.
1879;MATT;He's not directly, specifically controlling you right now, but he told you, Attack him, so you have to use all the things at your disposal to now attack him.
1880;TRAVIS;Okay.
1881;TRAVIS;I can't try and break the domination?
1882;TRAVIS;Or rage?
1883;MATT;Nope.
1884;MATT;You get a saving throw at the end of your turn.
1885;TRAVIS;I'm not raging.
1886;MATT;You're not raging.
1887;TRAVIS;So I only get two.
1888;MATT;One.
1889;MATT;You step over Cassandra, (impact noise) stepping on the back of her leg, and find your way right there, which is flanking him between Anders, so you have advantage on both your attacks.
1890;LAURA;Shit.
1891;TRAVIS;It's a three.
1892;LAURA;That's good.
1893;TRAVIS;21.
1894;LIAM;Yeah.
1895;MATT;Second attack.
1896;TRAVIS;26.
1897;MATT;Both hit.
1898;MATT;Go ahead and roll damage.
1899;TRAVIS;Really trying not to enjoy this.
1900;MATT;(laughs) With your flaming war hammer.
1901;TRAVIS;18 for the first one.
1902;MATT;18 points of slashing damage.
1903;MATT;No, sorry, bludgeoning damage.
1904;TRAVIS;Bludgeoning, yeah.
1905;TRAVIS;And fire.
1906;TRAVIS;20, 21.
1907;MATT;21 points of bludgeoning and fire damage with the second strike.
1908;LIAM;I am on my feet, but I am swaying back and forth.
1909;MATT;Unexpectedly, these two titanic slams hit you from behind.
1910;MATT;The first one throws you into Anders for a second.
1911;MATT;Anders then pushes you away, and as you are still reeling from the impact, you look up and see the hammer come down, and (whack) you move your head out in time, preventing you from being squished, but the impact hits your shoulder and the side of your neck, and your whole body crumples into itself.
1912;MATT;You cry out in pain instinctively, just (screams) from the hit.
1913;MATT;And your whole world blurs for a second as you're barely keeping yourself on your feet.
1914;MATT;Grog, that ends your turn.
1915;MATT;You can make another saving throw with advantage to try and shrug the effect.
1916;TRAVIS;Yeah.
1917;TRAVIS;Add wisdom right?
1918;MATT;Yes.
1919;TRAVIS;19?
1920;MATT;19.
1921;MATT;With that, the momentary controlled bloodshed fades.
1922;MATT;Your mind becomes your own, and what little bit of remorse you may feel for the battered Vax in front of you, you can't help but laugh a little bit.
1923;MATT;But then you turn your attention to the one who bent your will, and your rage begins to swell up inside you.
1924;MATT;So that ends your turn.
1925;MATT;Scanlan, you're up.
1926;SAM;I continue my long journey into the room.
1927;MATT;You just get past there, and you can see into the room.
1928;MATT;You have visual on, yeah, pretty much everything in the room from there.
1929;SAM;So I have to make a ranged shot if I'm to do anything.
1930;MATT;Correct, yeah.
1931;SAM;What do I see?
1932;SAM;Can I see how rough Vax is?
1933;MATT;At a glance, it's hard to tell.
1934;LIAM;I'm bleeding out my mouth.
1935;MATT;He's also facing away from you.
1936;SAM;Looks normal to me.
1937;MATT;You see Grog and Vax facing off the guy in the corner.
1938;MATT;You see two of these large armored entities.
1939;SAM;Okay, I'll go for them.
1940;MATT;Okay.
1941;SAM;Wand of Magic Missiles.
1942;SAM;And I'll shoot three at the one at the left.
1943;SAM;That's the first charge, and then use three additional charges on the one on the right.
1944;MATT;Okay.
1945;MATT;How many charges were restored in the wand from your last long rest?
1946;SAM;I roll every day, and I restored five and I had used five, so it's back to normal.
1947;SAM;I have seven total.
1948;MATT;So you're casting three on one and then--
1949;SAM;An additional three on the other.
1950;MATT;Okay, go for it.
1951;MATT;So that's 3d4 plus three to each one.
1952;MATT;Go for it.
1953;SAM;Right, 3d4.
1954;SAM;Okay.
1955;MATT;(magical sound effects) Releasing the wand on both flicks of your wrist, you can see these bursts of arcane energy swirl around and slam into each one of these creatures.
1956;SAM;3d4 plus three?
1957;SAM;Is that right?
1958;SAM;Is that how it works, Matt?
1959;MATT;Yes.
1960;SAM;Okay, so five (mumbles), eight.
1961;SAM;Lame.
1962;SAM;And (mumbles) nine, no wait.
1963;SAM;Yes, nine.
1964;MATT;Okay.
1965;MATT;All right.
1966;MATT;(explosion noise) The impact hits.
1967;MATT;You see the armor shake for a second and look angered and frustrated for what a faceless arcane entity in armor could, and both heads just go (shhhh) and look in your direction simultaneously.
1968;MATT;That ends your turn.
1969;SAM;Oh, and I will inspire Grog.
1970;SAM;(sings) This is the dawning of the age of a-Grog-ius.
1971;SAM;Age of a-Grog-ius.
1972;SAM;A-Grog-ius!
1973;SAM;(laughter)
1974;TRAVIS;d10?
1975;MATT;The words are lost on you, but it's a nice theme.
1976;MATT;You take a d10, yeah.
1977;TRAVIS;Not quite my jam, but I'll still take it.
1978;MATT;All right, that ends your turn.
1979;MATT;Anders, frustrated by the whole circumstance and on the cusp of a really bad circumstance, is going to attempt to cast Dimension Door.
1980;MARISHA;I knew it.
1981;MARISHA;I knew he was going to do that.
1982;LIAM;Do I get an attack?
1983;LIAM;A reaction attack?
1984;MATT;Not unless you have-- there's a feat that lets you do that.
1985;LIAM;No.
1986;MATT;Yeah, I think it's mage slayer.
1987;LIAM;I don't have that.
1988;MATT;Okay, all right.
1989;SAM;Do I see him?
1990;MATT;Yeah, you see him.
1991;SAM;I take out my broken shawm and I (piercing whistle).
1992;SAM;And I cast Counterspell on him.
1993;MATT;Right, because you took that when you leveled up.
1994;MATT;(cheering) All right.
1995;MATT;Oh lord bards.
1996;MATT;Shit.
1997;TRAVIS;(laughs) Shit.
1998;SAM;Wait, I have to tell a level, don't I?
1999;MATT;Yeah, you can tell me what level.
2000;SAM;Do I know, because he's a bard, what he's doing?
2001;MATT;You are very familiar with the spell.
2002;MATT;It is a 4th-level spell.
2003;SAM;Then I cast it at fourth level.
2004;MATT;Okay.
2005;MATT;Then there is no roll.
2006;MATT;With that, he takes a moment to finish casting.
2007;MATT;You see there's a moment where this bit of purple arcane energy, familiar to most of you as Scanlan's escapes, begins to sparkle behind him and as he goes to step into it, the shawm shrieks out into the room, he (groans) reaches up and covers his eye as it almost seems to be shrill to his head and cause the pain to pulse and the doorway just slams behind him.
2008;MATT;(panting)
2009;SAM;Uh-uh, that door is locked, motherfucker!
2010;SAM;(laughter) Get used to it, because I am!
2011;SAM;(laughter)
2012;MATT;Yeah, that's his turn.
2013;MATT;That was his action.
2014;MATT;He's going to use his bonus action to say, Come to my aid!
2015;MATT;Quickly!
2016;MATT;He's going to put another inspiration die to the other armor.
2017;MATT;And that's going to end his turn.
2018;MATT;It's now their turn.
2019;MATT;They are both going to come around.
2020;MATT;"This one is just going to move around Grog; no attack of opportunity because it's still in your melee."
2021;MATT;This one is going to step into range from over here.
2022;MATT;This one is going to turn and go for Percy.
2023;MATT;Sees this billowing as you're stuck there trying to fix the gun, and just rushing towards you with its shield forward, its horrible, jagged longsword in the air arcing towards you.
2024;MATT;Two strikes versus you.
2025;MATT;That'll be a 19?
2026;LIAM;That hits.
2027;MATT;Okay, first strike, you take nine points of slashing damage.
2028;LIAM;I'm down.
2029;MATT;So you go down.
2030;MATT;Second strike, because it's still going for you, hits automatically.
2031;MATT;It's an auto critical.
2032;MATT;You fail two death saving throws.
2033;LIAM;That's it?
2034;MATT;That ends its turn.
2035;MATT;This one is now going for you, Percy.
2036;MATT;First strike.
2037;MATT;That would be a nine.
2038;TALIESIN;No.
2039;MATT;It's going to use its inspiration die.
2040;MATT;Add nine to that, so 18.
2041;TALIESIN;18?
2042;TALIESIN;That's my armor class.
2043;MATT;(evil laugh) Bards!
2044;MATT;I'm sorry.
2045;MATT;I don't get to use them very often.
2046;MATT;So that is 11 points of slashing damage.
2047;MATT;And the other strike-- oh, that's a natural 18, so yeah, that will be... cocked.
2048;MATT;Oh, only eight points of slashing damage.
2049;TALIESIN;So 19 points of slashing damage, total?
2050;MATT;Correct.
2051;MATT;(whooshing) And it's painful, but not a huge thing at this point.
2052;MATT;You're so focused right now on the weapon.
2053;MATT;All right.
2054;MATT;That ends their turn.
2055;MATT;Keyleth, you're up.
2056;MARISHA;Okay, can I see Vax down?
2057;MARISHA;Which one is he on the ground?
2058;MATT;Vax is right there.
2059;MATT;You see him get slashed from behind, fall to the ground, and you see it raise a blade again and jam it into his torso, pull it out, and there's a streak of blood that just spatters across the ceiling from the force of the arc.
2060;TALIESIN;Yeah, I think you saw that.
2061;MARISHA;Okay.
2062;MARISHA;So I'm going to move around, tuck in the door a bit.
2063;MATT;Okay, so you move in and you see this.
2064;MATT;As you rush into the room, you see this arc happening.
2065;MARISHA;Can I tuck right here?
2066;MARISHA;God, I'm shaking.
2067;MARISHA;Yeah, right behind that door.
2068;MATT;Right there, yeah.
2069;MATT;That'll be pretty much your movement to get there.
2070;MARISHA;Okay, I'm going to duck down, crouch on the floor.
2071;MARISHA;I'm going to cast-- first I'm going to-- god I'm so nervous-- I'm going to use Healing Word on Vax, and heal that motherfucker.
2072;MATT;At what level?
2073;MARISHA;You're like down down, right?
2074;LAURA;He's unconscious.
2075;LIAM;And I-- there wasn't even any rolls for that, right?
2076;LAURA;No.
2077;MATT;If you're unconscious and a creature hits you, you automatically fail a death saving throw and if it's a critical hit, which if you're unconscious a hit is an automatic critical, it's technically two death saving throws.
2078;LIAM;Yeah, and just to understand the whole breakdown, but where do the three rolls come in?
2079;LAURA;If nobody hits you--
2080;LIAM;Oh, if nobody hits, got it.
2081;MATT;Yeah, if nobody hits you and it's your turn, you roll to see if you-- but if something keeps hitting you while you're down?
2082;MATT;Can kill you pretty quick.
2083;LIAM;Got it.
2084;MATT;Like two hits.
2085;MARISHA;But he just hit zero hit points, so whatever I bring will bring him over, correct?
2086;MATT;Yeah, and your death saves go away.
2087;MATT;It's per turn.
2088;MATT;Per time you go down.
2089;MARISHA;Okay, I'm just going to do a-- I'm sorry, a level one Healing Word for right now.
2090;MATT;Okay.
2091;MARISHA;Yes, which gives you 12 hit points.
2092;MARISHA;And then I'm going to use my bonus action to cast Grasping Vine, and I'm going to take the vine and I'm going to wrap it around--
2093;MATT;Your source?
2094;MARISHA;Huh?
2095;MATT;Which source?
2096;MARISHA;Next to me.
2097;MATT;Okay.
2098;MATT;So right here?
2099;MARISHA;I guess, yes.
2100;MATT;Okay so, out of the wood, a vine-- or it's not wood, actually.
2101;MATT;This would be a stone wall.
2102;MATT;So out of a crack in the wall, little bit of material begins to form into a giant vine that forms next to you.
2103;MATT;What are you doing with it?
2104;MARISHA;I want to wrap it around Cassandra's feet, her ankle, and I want to pull her toward me.
2105;MATT;You pull her over to the side and she gets pulled across the ground, and she's on her back now looking up.
2106;MATT;Her eyes are a little starry-eyed, but she's (panting).
2107;MATT;Looks very confused, and her eyes are still adjusting to the whole circumstance.
2108;MARISHA;And I say, Hi!
2109;MARISHA;Just hang on.
2110;MARISHA;And that's my turn.
2111;MATT;Yep.
2112;MATT;All right.
2113;MATT;Vex, you're up.
2114;LAURA;Okay.
2115;LAURA;So I saw him go down.
2116;MATT;Yes.
2117;LAURA;Does it look like he's awake now to me?
2118;LAURA;I'm mean, it was all happening very quickly.
2119;MATT;You have no idea.
2120;MATT;This all happens very quickly.
2121;MATT;You just saw your brother take a huge--
2122;LAURA;I scream and I run towards him.
2123;MATT;Okay.
2124;LAURA;I slide down on my knees and slide across the room and try to cast Healing Word the minute-- or cast Cure Wounds the minute I get to him.
2125;MATT;You won't get close enough to do it, unfortunately.
2126;LAURA;If I slide down and slide?
2127;MATT;Make an acrobatics check.
2128;MATT;For this circumstance, due to the circumstances with your brother being on the ground, I'll let this be a little more intense.
2129;SAM;With inspiration.
2130;LAURA;With inspiration.
2131;LAURA;That is-- wait, hold on.
2132;LIAM;Acrobatics.
2133;LAURA;Acrobatics?
2134;MATT;Yeah.
2135;LAURA;Oh, that's good.
2136;LAURA;17?
2137;MATT;17, all right.
2138;MATT;With that, you rush forward, just seeing this tunnel vision image of Vax on the ground, blood pooling under his form.
2139;MATT;You dart forward, slam on your knees and begin preparing the spell as you skid across the stone floor of the study.
2140;MATT;You reach out and your hands meet his form, stopping you in the process just as the surge of healing energy jolts through his body.
2141;MATT;So you can go ahead and cast it on him.
2142;LAURA;Okay, so I'm going to cast that at 3rd level.
2143;LAURA;So that's 3d8.
2144;LAURA;Where are my d8s?
2145;LAURA;That was the worst roll!
2146;LAURA;Nine!
2147;MATT;So you heal nine hit points.
2148;LIAM;That's good.
2149;LAURA;That's okay, because I slid to you.
2150;LIAM;It was amazing.
2151;LIAM;I'll never forget it.
2152;MATT;(laughs) Okay, that's your turn.
2153;LAURA;Yeah, and Trinket keeps dragging her.
2154;MATT;Forward?
2155;MATT;Okay.
2156;MATT;That ends your turn.
2157;MATT;All right, go ahead and roll an athletics check for Trinket.
2158;LAURA;Right, okay.
2159;LAURA;It's going to count even though it slipped out of my hand.
2160;LAURA;It's eight.
2161;MATT;Eight?
2162;MATT;Okay.
2163;MATT;Trinket, holding onto the scruff of Ripley's neck.
2164;MATT;Ripley then tugs away from the grip.
2165;MATT;Reaches into the pouch she had earlier.
2166;MATT;As a bonus action throws down a small rock that (explosion noise) fills this entire tunnel here with a 20 by 20 fog cloud, apparently.
2167;MATT;And now that she's disengaged, she's going to...
2168;MARISHA;She smoke-bombed out.
2169;LAURA;She ain't got no weapons.
2170;MATT;Nope.
2171;MATT;Trinket does get an attack of opportunity on her as she runs past.
2172;SAM;Yeah, Trinket does.
2173;SAM;Come on, Trinket.
2174;LAURA;All right, he's going to bite her.
2175;LAURA;Can he cannonball her as an attack of opportunity?
2176;MATT;No, unfortunately.
2177;LAURA;No?
2178;LAURA;Not so much?
2179;MATT;No, sorry.
2180;LAURA;Nine.
2181;MATT;Nine.
2182;MATT;All right
2183;LAURA;Oh wait!
2184;LAURA;Oh, no.
2185;LAURA;I've got to roll for attack first, huh?
2186;MATT;Yeah.
2187;LAURA;That was not what I was doing.
2188;LAURA;So that's 21.
2189;MATT;That hits, yeah.
2190;LAURA;Okay, good.
2191;LAURA;That's way better.
2192;MATT;She has no armor.
2193;LAURA;Oh, I don't know what I'm doing.
2194;LAURA;What is going on?
2195;LAURA;I never attack with Trinket.
2196;LAURA;13.
2197;MATT;Okay, got it.
2198;TALIESIN;Cautionary tale in there somewhere.
2199;MATT;She runs past.
2200;MATT;The whole area is obscured for Trinket.
2201;MATT;Trinket for the moment really has no idea really where she went as she rushed past, and bit out and is now giving out this (bear growl) notification growl sound, but in the chaos right now, it's not catching your attention as your brother nearly died before you.
2202;LAURA;Right.
2203;MATT;All right, that ends her turn.
2204;MATT;Percy, you're up.
2205;TALIESIN;I'm going to break-- first off, I'm going to fix my gun.
2206;MATT;Okay, go ahead and make your roll.
2207;TALIESIN;I'm going to make my roll.
2208;TALIESIN;Come on.
2209;TALIESIN;What do I have to roll?
2210;TALIESIN;(muttering) I hit the difficulty.
2211;TALIESIN;Does that--
2212;MATT;You hit it, then yeah.
2213;MATT;With the creature looming there, you manage to bend it back into place.
2214;MATT;You get it aligned as best as you can.
2215;MATT;That's your action, though.
2216;TALIESIN;If that had been a slightly bigger fuck-up, that would have been-- oh god!
2217;TALIESIN;Okay.
2218;MATT;So your gun's functional, but that's your action.
2219;TALIESIN;I'm going to use an action surge anyway, so it doesn't matter.
2220;MATT;Yes, you are.
2221;MATT;Okay.
2222;TALIESIN;I'm going to break off from this guy, and I'm going to rush towards Professor.
2223;MATT;Okay, gets an attack of opportunity on you.
2224;TALIESIN;Go ahead.
2225;TALIESIN;Don't care.
2226;MATT;Guy rolls a 14.
2227;TALIESIN;Yeah.
2228;MATT;So you just (whoosh) duck under it instinctually.
2229;MATT;It comes toward you.
2230;MATT;Eyes forward, you duck underneath the blade.
2231;TALIESIN;I push him in the face.
2232;TALIESIN;I don't care.
2233;MATT;Okay, you get right up to there, and you can see Anders backing away as you approach.
2234;TALIESIN;I'm going to unload in him.
2235;MATT;Go for it.
2236;TALIESIN;That's 21 to hit.
2237;MATT;That hits.
2238;TALIESIN;That's 25 to hit.
2239;MATT;That hits.
2240;TALIESIN;That's a natural 20.
2241;MARISHA;There is Percy!
2242;TRAVIS;What the fuck?
2243;MATT;Anti-Wheaton.
2244;TALIESIN;Okay, let's see, that's 11.
2245;MATT;Okay.
2246;TALIESIN;14.
2247;MATT;All righty.
2248;MATT;This is the critical.
2249;TALIESIN;Yep, this is the critical which is seven, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20 with fire damage.
2250;MATT;Okay.
2251;MATT;How do you want to do this?
2252;MATT;(cheering)
2253;TALIESIN;How close to him do I get?
2254;TALIESIN;And this was without smoke damage, I might add.
2255;MATT;You can get one more step up there.
2256;MATT;You can take the shots as you're stepping towards him, unloading.
2257;TALIESIN;Yeah, I'm unloading as I walk towards him.
2258;MATT;So the first one (gunshot) blasts out the shoulder.
2259;MATT;You can see the bone exposed, the metal breastplate sundered by the bullet, as he backs up (gasping) As you're walking towards him, he begins shouting, Percival, you disappoint us all.
2260;MATT;All you had to do was die like a good de Rolo.
2261;TALIESIN;Traitor!
2262;TALIESIN;And I've got two more shots.
2263;TALIESIN;Next shot.
2264;MATT;This one (gunshot) into his chest, and you can see the actual breastplate bends inward to the wound and he's (choking noise) spitting out blood from his mouth as he bends forward.
2265;MATT;This land has a greater destiny.
2266;MATT;You and that fool Ripley, you place your faith in toys and dust.
2267;MATT;You seek the transient truths.
2268;TALIESIN;How close am I to him at this point?
2269;MATT;You're stepping up to him.
2270;TALIESIN;Perfect.
2271;MATT;And as you're doing this, as you're pull the mask down, he says, I die to rise again.
2272;MATT;We are his blood.
2273;TALIESIN;I put my gun in his mouth to shut him the fuck up.
2274;TALIESIN;You're the face I saw when murder entered my heart.
2275;TALIESIN;This is your doing.
2276;TALIESIN;And I pull the trigger.
2277;MATT;With that, a resounding blast (explosion noise) echoes through the room.
2278;MATT;The back of his head just scatters across the wall behind him.
2279;MATT;The top of his head folds in a little bit from the lack of a substantial base, and he tumbles backwards, releasing the gun with a limp (splat) onto the ground behind.
2280;MATT;You're still holding the Pepperbox in front of you, hands shaking.
2281;MATT;As you hold it there, looking at it, you can see there's a flash of purple energy across the barrel that has Anders's name across it and (fluttering noise) the name burns away, leaving the barrel blank.
2282;TALIESIN;(heavy breathing)
2283;MATT;Smoke begins to subside a little bit.
2284;MATT;It's still there, but it seems like at the moment, it has this release aspect to it.
2285;TALIESIN;That's my turn.
2286;MATT;Yeah, that is your turn.
2287;MATT;Vax you're up.
2288;LIAM;How close are the suits of armor to me?
2289;LIAM;I can't tell.
2290;MATT;There's one over here, and there's one-- technically it's right next to you.
2291;LIAM;Right next to me?
2292;LIAM;And am I still prone?
2293;MATT;You're still prone.
2294;LIAM;So how much movement does it take to--
2295;MATT;Half your movement.
2296;LIAM;Half my movement.
2297;SAM;Don't give him an attack of opportunity.
2298;LIAM;No, I'm going to get up, and I'm going to use disengage.
2299;MATT;As a bonus action, okay.
2300;LIAM;Yeah, and I'm going to skip back into the corner, and at this point I can throw one dagger at that suit of armor, so I'm going to do that.
2301;MATT;Yes, you can.
2302;LIAM;That is 19.
2303;MATT;That hits.
2304;LIAM;I have no voice left.
2305;LIAM;That is an 11.
2306;MATT;11 points of damage, all righty.
2307;MATT;Great, okay.
2308;MATT;Let's see here now.
2309;MATT;That ends your turn.
2310;MATT;I had the list down here.
2311;MATT;All right.
2312;MATT;Grog, you're up.
2313;TRAVIS;Am I flanked by two suits of armor or just one?
2314;MATT;Nope, there's just one right next to you.
2315;TRAVIS;I'll turn to him and rage.
2316;MATT;Okay.
2317;MATT;Regular rage.
2318;TRAVIS;Regular rage, and swing away.
2319;LIAM;Classic rage, we call it.
2320;TRAVIS;Classic rage.
2321;LAURA;Good old classic rage.
2322;TRAVIS;14?
2323;MATT;14 hits.
2324;TRAVIS;Nice.
2325;TRAVIS;And 25.
2326;MATT;Both hit, yeah.
2327;LAURA;You get three hits.
2328;TRAVIS;Nah, just two.
2329;LAURA;I thought rage-- oh.
2330;TRAVIS;Believe me, I know.
2331;TRAVIS;17 with the fire damage.
2332;TRAVIS;First one.
2333;MATT;Okay.
2334;TRAVIS;18 on the second one.
2335;MATT;Okay, cool.
2336;MATT;So as you slam your hammer twice into it, the armor dents.
2337;MATT;You can see now, the energy that's holding it together is flickering, almost like the arcane entity that resides within it is having a hard time keeping itself in physical form.
2338;MATT;All right.
2339;MATT;That end your turn, unless you want to move or do anything else.
2340;TRAVIS;Nope.
2341;SAM;Did you hit?
2342;MATT;Scanlan.
2343;MATT;You're up.
2344;TRAVIS;Yeah, twice.
2345;SAM;Okay.
2346;SAM;Oh, me?
2347;SAM;Oh man, I can't do anything against these fuckers.
2348;MARISHA;Yes, you can.
2349;LIAM;You're Scanlan Shorthalt.
2350;MARISHA;Believe!
2351;SAM;All right.
2352;SAM;I'll enter the room, I suppose.
2353;SAM;Just a little.
2354;SAM;Right there.
2355;MARISHA;Just the tip.
2356;SAM;Just the tip, and shit.
2357;SAM;I don't want to waste anything on these fuckers.
2358;SAM;Okay, let's see here.
2359;SAM;I'll just do-- 2d8.
2360;SAM;All right, I'll run up.
2361;SAM;Actually, a little bit closer to the guy closest to me.
2362;MATT;Okay.
2363;MATT;You'll get into melee with him if you do.
2364;SAM;What does that mean?
2365;MATT;Means if you want to do any ranged attack or spell attack roll, you would have disadvantage on it, but otherwise it has no effect.
2366;LAURA;He can attack you, though, because he's right next to you.
2367;SAM;He won't be for long.
2368;MATT;Okay.
2369;SAM;So I get up close in, like five feet away, and then I'll just Thunderwave him.
2370;MATT;Okay.
2371;SAM;I do that thing where frat boys do the chest bump.
2372;MARISHA;Like, Come at me, bro?
2373;SAM;Yeah.
2374;SAM;(grunts)
2375;MARISHA;That's awesome.
2376;TRAVIS;(quietly) We did do that.
2377;MATT;All righty.
2378;SAM;That's just like 2d8.
2379;MATT;Yeah, okay.
2380;LIAM;Roll two d8s.
2381;MATT;Is this the 1st-level Thunderwave?
2382;SAM;I believe it is, yes.
2383;MATT;Okay, so makes a constitution saving throw.
2384;MATT;No, he rolled a natural four, so it takes 2d8 thunder damage and he is pushed over the table, and then would fall over if it wasn't now drifting above the ground a few inches.
2385;MATT;Rights itself, but it did push it away from you.
2386;MATT;Roll 2d8 damage.
2387;SAM;I did.
2388;SAM;It's only nine points of damage.
2389;MATT;Nine points of thunder damage against that helmed creature.
2390;MATT;All right, that brings us to their turn.
2391;MATT;This creature you just slammed into is going to rush back towards you.
2392;MATT;This one's going to turn and attack you, Grog.
2393;MATT;Two strikes against you.
2394;MATT;That is a 15.
2395;TRAVIS;Misses.
2396;MATT;Sorry.
2397;MATT;25.
2398;MATT;Rolled an 18 naturally.
2399;TRAVIS;Hits.
2400;MATT;And that is a 21.
2401;TRAVIS;Both hit.
2402;MATT;Okay, so you take six points of slashing damage, halved to three, and nine points slashing damage, halved to five.
2403;MATT;So eight points of slashing damage total.
2404;MATT;Two strikes against you, Scanlan.
2405;MATT;That is an 18.
2406;SAM;Oh, yes.
2407;SAM;That hits.
2408;MATT;Okay, and then a 12.
2409;SAM;Hey, that misses!
2410;MATT;So you take-- that's seven plus 11 points of slashing damage.
2411;MATT;(whoosh) As it goes to strike a second time, you see the second blow coming and just duck out of the way.
2412;MATT;That ends their go.
2413;MATT;Next up is Keyleth.
2414;MARISHA;So there are two guys alive right now?
2415;MATT;Correct, yes.
2416;MARISHA;One's on Scanlan.
2417;MATT;One's on Grog.
2418;MATT;The one on Grog is looking a little rough.
2419;MATT;The one near Scanlan's doing okay.
2420;MARISHA;How's Cassandra looking next to me?
2421;MATT;She's fine.
2422;MATT;There's no blood.
2423;MATT;"There's nothing; the wound is gone entirely."
2424;MATT;But other than that, she looks fine.
2425;MARISHA;Looks fine.
2426;MARISHA;Okay, I've got my Grasping Vine still up.
2427;MARISHA;I'm going to wrap it around the guy that's close to Scanlan and just yank him off of Scanlan.
2428;MATT;Okay.
2429;MATT;This pulls him over Scanlan's form and slams him right next to Cassandra.
2430;MARISHA;Okay, and then I will just go, oh!
2431;MARISHA;And pop him with my staff.
2432;MATT;Go for it.
2433;SAM;You can hit things?
2434;MARISHA;Yeah, I got a big old staff, yo!
2435;MARISHA;I'm not great at it, but I can do it.
2436;MARISHA;Oh, that's not bad.
2437;MARISHA;16.
2438;MATT;16 does not hit, unfortunately.
2439;MARISHA;Aw.
2440;MARISHA;(ping)
2441;SAM;He's got armor.
2442;MARISHA;It sounded nice, though.
2443;SAM;It did.
2444;MARISHA;Kind of resonated a little.
2445;MATT;Shakes off of it for a second.
2446;MATT;All right, so that ends your turn?
2447;MARISHA;Yep.
2448;MATT;All righty.
2449;MATT;That brings us to Vex.
2450;LAURA;So I'm still down on my knees.
2451;MATT;You're still down on your knees.
2452;MATT;Your brother got up and rushed off, he seems okay, (panting) taking a breath for himself.
2453;LAURA;I look up at Percy who is covered in smoke, and I grab his hand and I say, Percival, how are you?
2454;MATT;His head slowly turns towards you, the mask still on.
2455;MATT;You can see his eyes just barely through the glistening circular glass slots where he looks through.
2456;MATT;The smoke still billowing up from underneath, the head slowly turns towards you.
2457;TALIESIN;Fine.
2458;LAURA;Darling, take the mask off, and I--
2459;TALIESIN;I don't have a turn yet.
2460;MATT;No.
2461;LAURA;And I shoot at the guy that's attacking Grog.
2462;MATT;Okay.
2463;MATT;He is technically in melee with you, so you get disadvantage on these strikes unless you want to move away.
2464;LAURA;Does he get an attack of opportunity, though, if I scooch back?
2465;MATT;He would, unless-- he didn't take one against you when you ran back because you disengaged, so yes, he would.
2466;LAURA;Okay, yeah.
2467;MATT;Okay, so you move back a step.
2468;MATT;That is a 21.
2469;LAURA;Hits.
2470;MATT;Okay, you take nine points of slashing damage as you reach back.
2471;MATT;The creature (whoosh) arcs with its sword and manages to strike you.
2472;LAURA;Bastard!
2473;MATT;Roll for your attacks.
2474;LAURA;Okay, that is a 26 and a 23.
2475;MATT;Both hit.
2476;LAURA;I didn't Hunter's Mark him, because I'm brilliant.
2477;LAURA;Yes!
2478;LAURA;15, 30, 34 points.
2479;MATT;34 points of damage for both?
2480;LAURA;Yeah, two eights.
2481;LAURA;Plus 14.
2482;LAURA;Plus my bracers.
2483;MATT;Right.
2484;MATT;"You pull the arrows out and launch them both simultaneously, two arrows in one notch; release them both."
2485;MATT;One slams into the armor.
2486;MATT;That one goes underneath the helmet, and as it strikes you hear this horrible echoing (screeching) screech that echoes as the armor (thud) falls to the ground.
2487;TRAVIS;Yeah!
2488;MATT;You can take the rest of your movement, if you like.
2489;LAURA;I stand up.
2490;MATT;Well, you were standing up to move back.
2491;LAURA;I scooched back, right?
2492;MATT;Unless you wanted to be like--
2493;LAURA;Yeah I wanted to be like--
2494;MATT;Okay, so you pulled back while on the ground.
2495;MATT;Release the arrows.
2496;LAURA;Yeah, like up into them.
2497;MATT;There you go.
2498;MATT;All right.
2499;MATT;Stand up, brush yourself off.
2500;MATT;That ends your go.
2501;LAURA;And Trinket isn't allowed to move any at all?
2502;MATT;Trinket can, if you want.
2503;LAURA;Can he run after her?
2504;MATT;Yep.
2505;MATT;Rushes out.
2506;MATT;Will get there.
2507;MATT;Rushes through the fog and looks over and sees her right there.
2508;MATT;Okay.
2509;MATT;That ends your turn, and now it's her turn.
2510;MATT;She goes into a full dash and takes off.
2511;TALIESIN;Does Trinket get an attack of opportunity for that?
2512;MATT;Trinket does get attack of opportunity.
2513;LAURA;Okay.
2514;MARISHA;Come on, Trinket.
2515;TRAVIS;Scratch her up.
2516;LAURA;That's in the corner.
2517;LAURA;I can't really say.
2518;TRAVIS;Oh, you piece of shit
2519;LIAM;(clicks his teeth together)
2520;LAURA;Don't do that.
2521;LAURA;I hate that sound.
2522;LAURA;(laughter)
2523;MATT;So what did you roll?
2524;LAURA;That's a 12.
2525;LIAM;Good to know.
2526;MATT;12?
2527;LAURA;Yeah.
2528;MATT;12 does not hit, unfortunately.
2529;LAURA;No, it doesn't.
2530;MATT;Even with no armor, she's a pretty quick one.
2531;MATT;She ducks below and bolts down the hallway and around the corner.
2532;TRAVIS;Why did we let her have anything?
2533;MATT;All right.
2534;LAURA;You're out.
2535;MATT;So that ends your turn, her turn.
2536;MATT;Percy, you're up.
2537;TALIESIN;I'm going to pull off the mask and walk forward a bit, about there, and take three shots at the armor.
2538;MATT;Okay, regular shots?
2539;TALIESIN;Sharpshooter shots.
2540;MATT;Okay.
2541;TALIESIN;With one ice, so 14.
2542;MATT;14 misses.
2543;MATT;Deflects it with the shield.
2544;TALIESIN;Make sure I'm doing this right.
2545;TALIESIN;Yeah.
2546;TALIESIN;Goddamn it.
2547;TALIESIN;17.
2548;MATT;Deflects the second one with the shield.
2549;LAURA;Damn it!
2550;MATT;Heavy armor on this one.
2551;TALIESIN;Dropping sharpshooter for the third one.
2552;MATT;Okay.
2553;TALIESIN;Not that it helped.
2554;TALIESIN;16.
2555;MATT;This one actually manages to duck out of the way and splinters across the wall behind it.
2556;SAM;They're tough.
2557;TALIESIN;That's my turn.
2558;MATT;All righty.
2559;MATT;Vax, you're up.
2560;MARISHA;Kill them.
2561;LIAM;I'm just going to walk as far as I can, so 30 feet.
2562;MATT;There.
2563;LIAM;Am I within 40 feet?
2564;MATT;No.
2565;LIAM;Then I just stand.
2566;MATT;Well, you can use the rest of your action to keep moving, if you'd like.
2567;LIAM;All right, yeah.
2568;LIAM;I'm going to move around that table and get by Scanlan.
2569;LIAM;Stand right next to him.
2570;MATT;Okay, that brings us to Grog.
2571;TRAVIS;I would like to move to the suit of armor please.
2572;MATT;"Run towards it, jumping and putting one foot on the table; using that as momentum to rush in the air."
2573;MATT;Go ahead and roll your attack.
2574;TRAVIS;24?
2575;MATT;24 hits.
2576;TRAVIS;And 25.
2577;MATT;That hits.
2578;TRAVIS;20 with fire damage.
2579;MATT;Nice.
2580;TRAVIS;And 16 with fire damage.
2581;MATT;Gotcha.
2582;MATT;(grunts) Bringing the hammer down, the helmet actually gets pushed into the armor and has to reform itself.
2583;MATT;Before it has a chance to, you bring around the hammer and hit the shield with such force that it pushes it into itself and slams it against the wall.
2584;MATT;You take the back of the hammer and slam it up under the actual helmet, hitting the creature.
2585;MATT;You see the flames burn across the side of its arcane form, causing it to shimmer for a second.
2586;MATT;It's looking pretty rough.
