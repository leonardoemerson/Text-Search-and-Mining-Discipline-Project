0;0;MATT;"MATT: Hello everyone. My name is Matthew Mercer, voice actor and Dungeon Master for Critical Role on Geek & Sundry, where I take a bunch of other voice actors and run them through a fantastical fantasy adventure through the world of Dungeons & Dragons. We play every Thursday at 7:00pm Pacific Standard Time on Geek & Sundry's Twitch stream. Please come watch us live if you have the opportunity. Back episodes and future episodes will be uploaded on the Geek & Sundry website. You can also check them out there. In the meantime, enjoy!
Welcome to first episode of Critical Role, and what this basically is is a continuation of our weekly D&D game. Me and a bunch of other likely nerdy and enjoyable voice actors gathering around, rolling some dice, killing some creatures, having some adventure. Now we have the pleasure of bringing it on the stream for you to watch, enjoy, and occasionally interact with. Before we get to that, to give you a little backstory on the characters you'll be seeing this evening, we're going to play some videos for you in a second. Do note, for all you hardcore gamers out there, a lot of this is house-ruled, loosey-goosey having a good time. So all you number crunchers, stop paying attention there, just have fun with it. Nevertheless, we have some background story on many of the characters you'll be seeing this evening to help you jump into the story. Let's go ahead and enjoy those in a minute, then we'll introduce the players. So have fun!";Pre-Show
1;1;;;Pre-Show
2;2;MATT;MATT: Hey guys, welcome back. To give you a little heads up, we are playing the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. We recently converted over from Pathfinder, for those who play Pathfinder. One of our players was a gunslinger, for which there are no rules for in 5th edition. So I had to create and customize those for the game, so bear with us on that. That will be an interesting ride, regardless. We do have an eight-player game we've been playing for two years, which is a little crazy, which is why we go a little loose with the rules. It's a great group, it's a lot of fun. Not everyone can make every game, so we have enough players to definitely pull a party each time.;Pre-Show
3;3;ZAC;ZAC: Just so you know, we're having an audio bottleneck. It'll take about 30 seconds to work itself out.;Pre-Show
4;4;MATT;MATT: Okay, audio bottleneck.;Pre-Show
5;5;ZAC;ZAC: Tech problems that make me want to murder someone.;Pre-Show
6;6;MATT;MATT: That's okay. Just a second. You let us know when it's okay to talk.;Pre-Show
7;7;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I don't know what that means, a bottleneck.;Pre-Show
8;8;MATT;MATT: Are we all right? And how are we? Exterminate. Exterminate.;Pre-Show
9;9;SAM;SAM: Nice. Audio isn't working they're going to watch something else. Thanks, douche.;Pre-Show
10;10;(laughter);(laughter);Pre-Show
11;11;MATT;MATT: Is the mic adjusted? Is it any better?;Pre-Show
12;12;ZAC;ZAC: Better now. We're good.;Pre-Show
13;13;MATT;MATT: Well, great. Thank you guys. A couple of things transitioned from Pathfinder to 5th edition may be a little strange and fun. We have a lot of players, but they're great folks and most of that just means I have to work really hard to make sure the game keeps going, so that's on me. Ashley Johnson, unfortunately, cannot join us. She's our gnome cleric, Pike. She'll be here next week. Unfortunately, she's in London accepting a BAFTA, so I think we're okay. For the Last of Us. That's harsh. Also no donations this week, but going forward we will have donations available for those that will help partially run the show from our wonderful cameraman and crew. Also, half of our donations will go to the 826 charity. Marisha, if you want to talk a little about that.;Pre-Show
14;14;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yes! 826LA is a charity that focuses on tutoring children in an after-school program and helping specifically with creativity, storytelling, art and general things that relate to Dungeons & Dragons. You should definitely check out the Time Travel Mart. There is one in Echo Park and one in Mar Vista. They have this amazing storefront where you can buy these awesome tchotchkes and things that go immediately to support the charity and the stream. It's awesome. It's 826LA, you should look it up. There's a few all over the country.;Pre-Show
15;15;MATT;MATT: Yes. Also, as a heads up because I saw some of you guys ask me in the chatroom: These videos will be available on the Geek & Sundry YouTube Channel soon enough, as well as a more extensive backstory of the party. We'll have all that content ready for you so you don't have to memorize it. Maybe a bio page, I don't know. We'll figure something out. It'll be fine. Anyway, let's open that up. You know who I am. Matthew Mercer, voice actor and I've been running this game for two years. I'm a hardcore nerd. Let's go around the table and introduce our players so you can attach the faces to the intros you just saw. Let's start on this side with Travis.;Pre-Show
16;16;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh! Hi. I'm Travis Willingham, voice actor, gamer. I play Grog the goliath barbarian.;Pre-Show

20;20;MATT;MATT: The ranger with the bear.;Pre-Show
21;21;LAURA;LAURA: The ranger with the bear named Trinket, in case you didn't catch that. His name is Trinket and he's amazing.;Pre-Show
22;22;LIAM;LIAM: Hi, I'm Liam O'Brien. I'm playing Vax'ildan. This one's twin. We're half-elven twins. I started playing D&D when I was 13 and I can't believe this is happening. So cheers. Cheers to this.;Pre-Show
23;23;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: My name is Taliesin Jaffe. I'm a voice actor, director, and I've been playing some form of Dungeons & Dragons, and if you can't tell by my black clothing, a lot of Vampire the Masquerade when I was a teenager. There was a problem. I'm playing Percy, the Gunslinger. I'm the reason all the rules are all messed up.;Pre-Show
24;24;MARISHA;MARISHA: I am Keyleth, the druid from the tribe of the Air Ashari. I am a half-elven person.;Pre-Show
25;25;MATT;MATT: No, you're elven.;Pre-Show
26;26;MARISHA;MARISHA: No, half-elf.;Pre-Show
27;27;MATT;MATT: Half-elf. Okay.;Pre-Show
28;28;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yeah, Come on, man. I've been half-elf since day one. Half-elven. Yes! You can see me shooting lightning and turning into awesome animals./;Pre-Show
29;29;MATT;MATT: Orion.;Pre-Show
30;30;ORION and MATT;ORION and MATT: Hi.;Pre-Show
31;31;ORION (Cont'd);ORION (Cont'd): Hey, everybody. I'm Orion Acaba and I'm also a voice actor. I do things.;Pre-Show
32;32;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, I'm Marisha Ray, by the way.;Pre-Show
33;33;MARISHA;MARISHA: Did I say that?;Pre-Show
34;34;ORION;ORION: Keyleth is Marisha Ray.;Pre-Show
35;35;MATT;MATT: Let Orion have his moment. Don't try and break–;Pre-Show
36;36;ORION;ORION: No, it's our moment.;Pre-Show
37;37;MATT;MATT: There you go. All right.;Pre-Show
38;38;ORION;ORION: I'm Tiberius the awesome sorcerer.;Pre-Show
39;39;MATT;MATT: Dragonborn sorcerer.;Pre-Show
40;40;ORION;ORION: Dragonborn, yeah! That's right.;Pre-Show
41;41;SAM;SAM: I'm Sam Riegel: a voice actor, and stuff. My character is Scanlan Shorthalt. The gnome bard who sings a lot. Let's start playing, yeah?;Pre-Show
42;42;(cheering);(cheering);Pre-Show
43;43;MATT;MATT: All right! Let's jump on in. Thank you. Last we left off, to give you a little backstory. The party had completed a large venture in saving the nearby city of Emon. One of the central capitals of this human civilization of Tal'Dorei. They managed to halt a demonic insurrection within the throne and as such were greeted to a hero's celebration and had a keep built in their honor. Over the six month period of the keep being constructed, they went their own ways and then returned to see its final creation. However, they did not have a chance to really enjoy it immediately as one of their good friends and allies, Arcanist Allura Vysoren of the Tal'Dorei council came to them requesting their aid saying that a long time friend of hers, Lady Kima of Vord, who is a very well known and very well respected halfling paladin of Bahamut, the Platinum Dragon, had been gone on a pilgrimage for a while, essentially a vision quest that is part of her own development as a paladin. As part of this, she let the information go to Allura that a dark vision had come to her saying that some sort of evil root is beginning to breed beneath Kraghammer and the mountains within Kraghammer, which is the nearby dwarven civilization that you guys have previously not been allowed entry to because the dwarves weren't fans of nobody without any political means of entry. However, she managed to acquire the necessary documentation and offered you a very substantial reward should you find the whereabouts of Lady Kima of Vord and hopefully bring her back safely. You left on the pathway to the dwarven citadel of Kraghammer. You were ambushed by a group of roaming barbarian goliaths. Part way through the battle, Grog managed to recognize one of them as a previous ally and no longer an ally at this time.;Part I
44;44;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Son of a bitch.;Part I
45;45;MATT;MATT: Yep, the barbarian for his first and only time so far managed to avert battle through a social encounter and rolled pretty damn well on a persuasion check. So you got one. You get one. You got your one. Never again.;Part I
46;46;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Next time he dies.;Part I
47;47;MATT;MATT: Yeah. Essentially. Which managed to not turn it into complete bloodshed. You continued on your way to Kraghammer, presented your paperwork, were given entry into the city and that is where we begin this adventure.;Part I
48;48;LAURA;LAURA: Oh no.;Part I
49;49;SAM;SAM: In the city of Kraghammer?;Part I
50;50;MATT;MATT: In the city of Kraghammer.;Part I
51;51;SAM;SAM: Wow! This is fantastic.;Part I
52;52;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We're in, right?;Part I
53;53;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yes. We were at the door. We were talking to someone right?;Part I
54;54;MATT;MATT: Yeah, you were talking to the front guards at the gate of Kraghammer. They have begrudgingly let you inside. Giving you a couple of pointers little prods and sent you into the city proper. You made your way through the darkened alleyways and stone carved tunnel that leads into the main, central portion of the city proper. An enormous underground metropolis sprawls out before you. The dark earth and shadows creating beautiful stone work, marble columns, archways, and labyrinthine bridges climbing across the vertical cityscape. All warmed with the red glow of some strange, crimson rock peppered throughout the town as a light source. A large metal forge envelops the center of this cylindrical city. The entire is a three-tiered cylindrical city that is built into the ground of the mountain itself. Welcome to Kraghammer!;Part I
55;55;LIAM;LIAM: Remind us. Did we bullshit our way in here, or did–;Part I
56;56;LAURA;LAURA: No, we had a way in.;Part I
57;57;MATT;MATT: No, Allura got your paperwork so you were actually able to get in this time.;Part I
58;58;LAURA;LAURA: But, Ashley speaks Dwarvish. Pike speaks–;Part I
59;59;MATT;MATT: Pike speaks Dwarvish and she's not here.;Part I
60;60;ORION;ORION: I speak Dwarvish as well!;Part I
61;61;LAURA;LAURA: Oh good!;Part I
62;62;ORION;ORION: I do.;Part I
63;63;SAM;SAM: That's fantastic.;Part I
64;64;MATT;MATT: The only other bit of information you have about the whereabouts of her is that she came here to go into the mine Apparently, a mithral mine where this evil is supposedly brewing. You heard that the one person who owns the biggest part of the mithral market here cornering, his name was the dwarven Lord Nostoc Greyspine. That was the only name you had in regards to this deep earth quarry.;Part I
65;65;SAM;SAM: Greyspine?;Part I
66;66;MATT;MATT: Greyspine, correct.;Part I
67;67;SAM;SAM: We have to go find him, don't we?;Part I
68;68;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I think before we do anything we should find a place to sleep.;Part I
69;69;ORION;ORION: That's true!;Part I
70;70;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh! We're all jacked up from before, right?;Part I
71;71;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Wouldn't it be nice to put everything down for a little while.;Part I
72;72;SAM;SAM: Of course. I've got a lot of booty that I need to stow.;Part I
73;73;ORION;ORION: Good way to phrase that, Scanlan. Also, I would like to check out any places where they might have enchanted libraries or what not.;Part I
74;74;SAM;SAM: Can you stick with us? You're the only one that speaks Dwarvish.;Part I
75;75;LIAM;LIAM: Yes, you're getting ahead of yourself.;Part I
76;76;ORION;ORION: I'm just saying put it on the list.;Part I
77;77;LIAM;LIAM: Let's look around. Are there any dwarves in the vicinity?;Part I
78;78;MATT;MATT: Oh, there are many! As you finish this conversation you look about there are two guards posted nearby wearing dark crimson and brass chest plates that have a uniform scar carved across the front. It's actually built into the armor itself as a design. They're both staring awkwardly at all of you arguing in the middle of this entry thoroughfare of Kraghammer.;Part I
79;79;LIAM;LIAM: Tiberius, make with the dwarf-talk, please.;Part I
80;80;ORION;ORION: Hello, friends. My associates and I were looking for a place of lodging for the night and a place of reputable reputation.;Part I
81;81;MATT;MATT: One dwarf shouts over to another one, “You hear that, Jepson?! They're looking for a place to “stay.” “Aye, I heard that right. It's about time we had some new folk in town. Well, if you're 'looking for a place to stay' I'd say your best bet would be the Pig Pits.”;Part I
82;82;SAM;SAM: Is that the name of a place?;Part I
83;83;MATT;MATT: “Yes! Certainly! The Pig Pits.”;Part I
84;84;SAM;SAM: All right.;Part I
85;85;MATT;MATT: “Ask for the Pig Pits–”;Part I
86;86;LAURA;LAURA: Those are actually pig pits, isn't it?;Part I
87;87;MARISHA;MARISHA: I feel like we're being hazed.;Part I
88;88;MATT;MATT: “What?! No! Not at all.”;Part I
89;89;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: That sounds fine with me.;Part I
90;90;LIAM;LIAM: This is Common?;Part I
91;91;MATT;MATT: This is all in Common, yeah.;Part I
92;92;SAM;SAM: Which way to the Pig Pits, sir?;Part I
93;93;MATT;MATT: “Pig Pits are that way.” He points over the edge and you see down past the central forge structure in the city to the very bottom nearby a large temple that envelops the bottom floor of Kraghammer proper there is indeed a distant slop of mud where internal livestock are being kept.;Part I
94;94;LAURA;LAURA: I bring out a piece of gold. Please, sir, we're looking for a place to stay that isn't covered in mud.;Part I
95;95;MATT;MATT: “It's good to see that at least one of you speaks Dwarvish.” Takes the coin, kinks it in his teeth and goes, “All right, now if you're looking for a proper place to stay you're going to look for the Iron Hearth Tavern. That is to your left up that way no more than a half mile. Keep an eye out. Listen for the laughter and the people who are very drunk. That's your best bet.”;Part I
96;96;LAURA;LAURA: Thank you, sir.;Part I
97;97;MATT;MATT: “No worries.”;Part I
98;98;LAURA;LAURA: I like your armor by the way.;Part I
99;99;MATT;MATT: “Well, thank you kindly.”;Part I
100;100;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Was that a wink?;Part I
101;101;LAURA;LAURA: It was.;Part I
102;102;LIAM;LIAM: That's all she does.;Part I
103;103;LAURA;LAURA: That's all I do is wink at people.;Part I
104;104;LIAM;LIAM: It's a nervous tic, really.;Part I
105;105;MATT;MATT: It's a feat she took. You progress to the western side of the Kraghammer rotation as you curl around the central platform. Making your way eventually to the outside of this rather large, central tavern inn. As you walk in, you can hear music playing, you can hear laughter and boastful cheer, you can hear some arguments in the distance. You can hear it from a good two or three buildings away. This is definitely a central social environment here in Kraghammer. As you walk inside, you– Let me get some proper tavern music here for you.;Part I
106;106;SAM;SAM: Smells in here.;Part I
107;107;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Drinking territory.;Part I
108;108;MATT;MATT: You hear some loud boisterous (hearty dwarven laughter), some drinks being clinked together. As you walk in, the first thing that catches you is the scent of stale alcohol and smoked wood of some kind.;Part I
109;109;MATT;MATT: There are tables, most of them in decent condition, some of them half-broken and repaired, probably from some previous encounter in the bar. In the center of the room, there looks to be a not currently in use, specifically built brawling circle. It's about 30 feet by 20 feet. It's more of an oval. It's not in use, currently.;Part I
110;110;SAM;SAM: An octagon?;Part I
111;111;MATT;MATT: Essentially.;Part I
112;112;LIAM;LIAM: How high is the ceiling here? Can Grog fit in here?;Part I
113;113;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh right, am I like–?;Part I
114;114;MATT;MATT: The ceiling actually is considered vaulted ceiling for dwarves so it runs at about seven feet. For Grog, it's uncomfortable, almost scratching your head across the top. As you enter, about seven or eight of the nearby dwarves at the front door go, (hearty laughter). They look immediately at the ragtag non-dwarven group that just stumbled into the center of the tavern.;Part I
115;115;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: What're you looking at?;Part I
116;116;MATT;"MATT: “It's not very often we get someone with that kind of a mug on you. Let me buy you a drink, come ""sit down!”";Part I
117;117;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: My kind of people, see you later! I go grab the drink with the lovely dwarves.;Part I
118;118;LAURA;LAURA: We grab a table next to the dwarves with Grog.;Part I
119;119;MATT;MATT: Both tables next to the table they're at are completely filled with dwarves.;Part I
120;120;LIAM;LIAM: I take a sack of gold out of my own pocket, slam it down on the table–;Part I
121;121;LAURA;LAURA: A sack of gold, are you crazy?!;Part I
122;122;LIAM;LIAM: Gentlemens and ladies. Ladies and gentlemen, we are traveling from far away. We just arrived from Emon. We are fascinated to see your underground city and to celebrate the occasion I would like to buy every dwarf in here a round. Bartender!;Part I
123;123;MATT;MATT: The music stops. The conversation stops. All dwarven eyes turn to the table and they all turn to a single dwarven woman in the back who's behind one of the bars, who has a towel over one arm. She's looking around, she's staring confused at you and all eyes are on her, and she goes, “Well, it's about time someone around here had some generosity! Certainly, pay upfront. Drinks all around on this half-elven gentleman.”;Part I
124;124;LIAM;LIAM: Let it rain!;Part I
125;125;MARISHA;MARISHA: Make it rain.;Part I
126;126;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I would like a cask of ale.;Part I
127;127;LIAM;LIAM: I'll need your largest bowl of ale for this one here.;Part I
128;128;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Cask. Cask of ale. Cask.;Part I
129;129;MATT;MATT: “No worries, Adra's got your back, be right back.” She wanders off to the back room, comes back and starts pouring stein after stein after stein of ale.;Part I
130;130;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah. Keep going. Looks good.;Part I
131;131;MATT;MATT: You do notice she is definitely the head of this tavern and all of her barkeeps are male and seem to be worked rather ragged.;Part I
132;132;LAURA;LAURA: What was her name?;Part I
133;133;SAM;SAM: Excuse me, miss. You.;Part I
134;134;MATT;MATT: “Adra. Yeah?”;Part I
135;135;SAM;SAM: I'm sorry?;Part I
136;136;MATT;MATT: “Adra.”;Part I
137;137;SAM;SAM: Adra! You run a fantastic establishment.;Part I
138;138;MATT;MATT: “That's right I do!”;Part I
139;139;SAM;SAM: Thank you for welcoming us and allowing us to buy this round.;Part I
140;140;MATT;MATT: “Of course. Patrons that come and drop coin like that are welcome any time.”;Part I
141;141;SAM;SAM: Well, thank you for your hospitality. Might we inquire about staying here the night? Do you have an inn with the establishment?;Part I
142;142;MATT;"MATT: She reaches below and pulls out a big tome and starts thumbing through it. “You know, ""actually we have openings right now on the second floor.”";Part I
143;143;SAM;SAM: Several rooms, or just one?;Part I
144;144;MATT;MATT: “Do you need them side by side?”;Part I
145;145;SAM;SAM: That would be nice.;Part I
146;146;MATT;MATT: “We could pull him there and push him into room seven.”;Part I
147;147;SAM;SAM: Something with a little bed for me.;Part I
148;148;MATT;MATT: “Giles!” One of the dwarf barmaiders comes over. “Aye?” “Get Stepheson out of his room, move him to the third floor. We have to open a block for our new guests.” “Ugh, fine.” The older dwarf stumbles his way up the stairs begrudgingly. “Right, so I can get a room for each of you. We're looking at eight rooms separately, that will run you per evening about 25 gold pieces. Does that sound about right?”;Part I
149;149;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Total?;Part I
150;150;MATT;MATT: “25 total pieces.”;Part I
151;151;LAURA;LAURA: You want to share a room?;Part I
152;152;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yeah! We'll bunk up.;Part I
153;153;SAM;SAM: Grog, you and me. I can sleep on your feet.;Part I
154;154;LAURA;LAURA: Probably like 15 gold then for just that amount.;Part I
155;155;MATT;MATT: She visibly deflates a little bit and is like, “All right, fair enough. Five rooms it is. 15 gold per room.”;Part I
156;156;SAM;SAM: We're penny pinchers.;Part I
157;157;MATT;MATT: “How long do you expect to stay?”;Part I
158;158;ORION;ORION: At least a few days.;Part I
159;159;SAM;SAM: I'd say a week.;Part I
160;160;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: With an indefinite hold, we have business in the city.;Part I
161;161;MATT;MATT: “Right! Well how bout we pay the week in advance and I'll give you a discount?”;Part I
162;162;LAURA;LAURA: What's the discount?;Part I
163;163;MARISHA;MARISHA: Wait. I thought we were going to be heading south?;Part I
164;164;MATT;MATT: “Let's say, 100 gold for the week, all five rooms.”;Part I
165;165;LIAM;LIAM: We're pretty flush, I think we can handle it.;Part I
166;166;LAURA;LAURA: Yes. That works.;Part I
167;167;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: This doesn't terrify me.;Part I
168;168;LAURA;LAURA: I think I did the math wrong.;Part I
169;169;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I was told there would be no math.;Part I
170;170;SAM;SAM: Sounds good!;Part I
171;171;LAURA;LAURA: Gah! I hate not having a calculator! Fine!;Part I
172;172;MATT;MATT: “Ah! Great!” She pulls back and pulls some keys out and hands them to the rest of you. Hands you some paperwork, shows you which rooms are yours and says, “You're welcome to stay all you like, ask questions, hang about. Just make sure you don't do anything stupid near the Carvers.”;Part I
173;173;ORION;ORION: Ooh! Like what? I do things like that all the time!;Part I
174;174;LIAM;LIAM: Sorry. Our Dwarvish is a little thick. Near the–?;Part I
175;175;MATT;MATT: “The Carvers, the Carvers!”;Part I
176;176;LAURA;LAURA: The carvas. Of course.;Part I
177;177;MATT;MATT: “The Carvers!”;Part I
178;178;ORION;ORION: The Converse! Of course!;Part I
179;179;SAM;SAM: The Car Verse?;Part I
180;180;MATT;MATT: “Is this your first time in Kraghammer?”;Part I
181;181;ALL;ALL: Yes!;Part I
182;182;MATT;MATT: “The Carvers are the guard that run this city. They're the ones that keep the law.”;Part I
183;183;LAURA;LAURA: The scar!;Part I
184;184;MATT;MATT: “Yes, the armor, the Carvers!”;Part I
185;185;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, what is with the scar? I've got one myself.;Part I
186;186;MATT;MATT: She leans back and as you reveal the rather gnarled scar on your chest. She reels back a bit and two of the nearby dwarves go, “Yeah!” They chug down their drinks.;Part I
187;187;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah! More drinking!;Part I
188;188;MATT;MATT: They start showing their scars and are like, “Oh no! I got this one from an iron bolt!” They start talking about different creatures they fought. “All right. Well, the Carvers are a bit of a– how do I put it? A military class in this city. They run a very tight ship on the streets, so be careful.”;Part I
189;189;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: That shouldn't be a problem. Mostly we are looking for Lord Greyspine, if I recall. We have business with him.;Part I
190;190;LAURA;LAURA: We might have business with you, if you've seen a halfling come through.;Part I
191;191;MATT;"MATT: She thinks to herself and goes, “There was a halfling woman, but she was staying at the ""Firebrook Inn.”";Part I
192;192;LAURA;LAURA: The Firebrook.;Part I
193;193;MATT;MATT: “The bottom floor, for a couple of weeks. There was talk about her. She got in a few fights herself. The one with the silver armor? That one? Yeah, she was a firebrand if ever I saw one. Right up my alley, I like that one.”;Part I
194;194;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: How long ago would you say this was?;Part I
195;195;MATT;MATT: “Oh, she went through a few weeks. I haven't seen her recently.”;Part I
196;196;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Thank you. Perfect.;Part I
197;197;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Is there a champion of the circle of fighting in the tavern? Is there a reigning–;Part I
198;198;SAM;SAM: Already, Grog?!;Part I
199;199;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Well, I have to know these things!;Part I
200;200;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: He has to do something.;Part I
201;201;MATT;MATT: She turns the barrel that she has on the table towards you a little bit and you can see the actual symbol, this burned image on the side that says, “Balgus Brewery.” She goes, “That'll be Balgus. The one that supplies us with what you're drinking. He's the undefeated champion. But I don't think he's quite right to fight at the moment.” She points towards the very edge of the bar and you see one older grizzled dwarf, long gray hair pulled into straight braids in the back, big bushy beard that's all shoved up into his face because he's asleep, drunk as a skunk, on the edge of the bar.;Part I
202;202;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: My type of dwarf. Maybe we'll can use him as a merc later or something. All right, another time then.;Part I
203;203;SAM;SAM: Another time.;Part I
204;204;LIAM;LIAM: Save it for a rainy day.;Part I
205;205;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Does it rain down here?;Part I
206;206;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I don't think they have rainy days.;Part I
207;207;MATT;MATT: “You said Greyspine?”;Part I
208;208;LAURA;LAURA: Yes, Greyspine.;Part I
209;209;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We are looking to set up a meeting.;Part I
210;210;MATT;MATT: “Which Greyspine?”;Part I
211;211;SAM;SAM: Nostoc?;Part I
212;212;MATT;MATT: “Nostoc Greyspine. He's definitely a business type one.”;Part I
213;213;ORION;ORION: Well who's the friendlier Greypsine?;Part I
214;214;MATT;MATT: “The friendlier of the types would probably be the head of House Greyspine.”;Part I
215;215;MARISHA;MARISHA: Wait, how many Greyspines are there?;Part I
216;216;MATT;MATT: “Oh, well there's probably several at this point, I've lost track. The family line's been going for a while. However, of House Greyspine currently, Ironkeeper Gradim Greyspine is the head of this entire city. Voted in ten years ago, actually. He's head of the council.”;Part I
217;217;MARISHA;MARISHA: Ironkeeper what?;Part I
218;218;MATT;MATT: “Ironkeeper Gradim Greypsine. Gradim! You're– (sigh) These commoners. Learn to speak the language!”;Part I
219;219;ORION;ORION: I understood!;Part I
220;220;LIAM;LIAM: Adra, may I ask, obviously we have no dwarves in our little party.;Part I
221;221;MATT;MATT: “Unfortunately.”;Part I
222;222;LAURA;LAURA: Unfortunately for us.;Part I
223;223;LIAM;LIAM: Sorry, about that. You're very welcoming. We appreciate that. How welcoming would you say the city is to outsiders? Would we stick out like a sore thumb?;Part I
224;224;MATT;MATT: “Probably. As long as you don't do anything stupid. As long as you keep the coin flowing, and as long as you stay to the upper levels. The lower levels you get to more of the business: the miners, the forges, the foundries. When you get to the business areas, that's where the guard gets heavier and that's where folks don't like you poking near their money.”;Part I
225;225;SAM;SAM: So the lower levels would have the mithral mines?;Part I
226;226;MATT;MATT: “The mithral mine, aye.”;Part I
227;227;SAM;SAM: There's one?;Part I
228;228;MATT;MATT: “There is one now. It's all been, and has been for quite some time, completely helmed up and run by House Greypsine. The Keystone Quarry is what you're looking for.”;Part I
229;229;LIAM;LIAM: We're not really interested in that. We just want to see the city. Our business is elsewhere.;Part I
230;230;MATT;MATT: “Yeah, I would not recommend it. Not without proper business credentials on that. You'll end up being questioned very heavily.”;Part I
231;231;LIAM;LIAM: Sounds like a dirty business, anyway.;Part I
232;232;LAURA;LAURA: Right.;Part I
233;233;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, you want to stay away from those miners Scanlan, that's a dirty business.;Part I
234;234;MATT;MATT: She gives you a look almost like it was a slightly racist statement, but then passes it off because you paid her a lot of coin today.;Part I
235;235;MARISHA;MARISHA: So racist.;Part I
236;236;LAURA;LAURA: So No-stock. Nostoc?;Part I
237;237;LIAM;LIAM: Nostoc.;Part I
238;238;LAURA;LAURA: Nostoc Greyspine.;Part I
239;239;MATT;MATT: “Yes.”;Part I
240;240;LAURA;LAURA: You said that he's kind of a–?;Part I
241;241;MATT;MATT: “Oh, there's a reason he's the one put in charge of the mines and the businesses and the foundries.”;Part I
242;242;LAURA;LAURA: Oh. Where is he located, exactly?;Part I
243;243;MATT;MATT: “Well, if he's not home at the actual Greyspine Manor– which is a sprawling house. It contains all the ones who live there.”;Part I
244;244;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We're going there!;Part I
245;245;MATT;MATT: “He's probably down at the actual–” What is it? Pardon. Bear with me. Consult my notes! “He's probably down by the Greyspine quarry itself, keeping an eye on the business there.” There's a nearby dwarf having a few drinks, goes, “Ah, Greyspine, there's been troubles round there! Apparently, a friend of mine works there. Got a big, nasty scar last week. Wouldn't even pay him for his time off to heal. It's bullshit!” He slams his drink down on the table.;Part I
246;246;SAM;SAM: Down at the quarry?;Part I
247;247;MATT;MATT: “Aye.”;Part I
248;248;MARISHA;MARISHA: How did your friend get this nasty cut?;Part I
249;249;MATT;MATT: “He works there! Said there was things pouring out of the caves. Goblins and the like!”;Part I
250;250;LAURA and SAM;LAURA and SAM: Goblins?;Part I
251;251;MATT;MATT: “Ah, goblins are nothing.”;Part I
252;252;MATT;MATT: “Seems there's something other than goblins poking out through this hole. Just saying, that business is in for a serious problem if it doesn't change.”;Part I
253;253;LAURA;LAURA: Does your friend ever have drinks here? “No. He's been sober for two years. We're not friends anymore.” Tugs on his beard a little bit.;Part I
254;254;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh. I'm sorry. I think.;Part I
255;255;SAM;SAM: A lot to process.;Part I
256;256;MATT;MATT: He pours another drink. At which point, Adra slaps his hand and says, “Pay that. He bought one round!” He finishes his drink and walks away.;Part I
257;257;ORION;ORION: Excuse me, one thing, Adra, are there any mystics in this particular town that study any arcane arts?;Part I
258;258;MATT;MATT: “Of course! What, you think dwarves are just the baseline folks who brawl each other?”;Part I
259;259;MARISHA;MARISHA: So many racist comments. Jeez!;Part I
260;260;MATT;MATT: “What you're looking for is House Thunderbrand. They are the ones who, by blood, have the arcane arts in their family line.”;Part I
261;261;ORION;ORION: Interesting.;Part I
262;262;MATT;MATT: “They run most of the enchantment process in the city, they also train– they call it train– some of us call it more 'indoctrination.' But, they're definitely the focus of all arcane arts here in Kraghammer.”;Part I
263;263;ORION;ORION: Thank you.;Part I
264;264;SAM;SAM: Thank you for your time, Adra. Carry on with your evening. We'll seek you out if we have any more questions.;Part I
265;265;MATT;MATT: “Certainly. Now if you don't mind,” She scoots you aside, and you see a line, a queue of dwarves behind her, with their empty cups, waiting to get to her to fill up the drinks that you bought.;Part I
266;266;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, that's– we did promise that.;Part I
267;267;LIAM;LIAM: Enjoy, gentlemen! And lady.;Part I
268;268;LAURA;LAURA: What time of day is it?;Part I
269;269;MATT;MATT: Best that you can tell, inside– you can't. You just arrived, probably around 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, so you're probably pushing sunset right about now.;Part I
270;270;LAURA;LAURA: Do dwarves carry the same schedule?;Part I
271;271;MARISHA;MARISHA: I don't know.;Part I
272;272;LAURA;LAURA: Does anyone know?;Part I
273;273;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: There's only one way to find out.;Part I
274;274;MATT;MATT: Make an intelligence check!;Part I
275;275;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh! Roll it! You're the first one.;Part I
276;276;LIAM;LIAM: First die rolling. Nice!;Part I
277;277;LAURA;LAURA: 18, plus, what is that? Investigation? Or insight?;Part I
278;278;MATT;MATT: This would be a straight intelligence roll on this one, so your general knowledge of dwarves.;Part I
279;279;LAURA;LAURA: Oh. 20, then.;Part I
280;280;MATT;MATT: 20. That's not too bad! In your experience, you know dwarves, depending on their lifestyle and what they do for a living, their clocks can run differently, but for the most part, they run in tandem with most other races just because it makes it easier for dealing with outside forces. But, like I said, it's very variable. There is no set, locked time of: this is morning, this is evening, they just sleep when they need to and wake up when they need to.;Part I
281;281;LAURA;LAURA: All right. Good to know.;Part I
282;282;MARISHA;MARISHA: It's like living in Alaska.;Part I
283;283;LAURA;LAURA: Right!;Part I
284;284;MATT and MARISHA;MATT and MARISHA: Dwarven Alaska.;Part I
285;285;SAM;SAM: Yes, fellows, what should we do?;Part I
286;286;LAURA;LAURA: Check out the Firebrook Inn, yes. That was where Lady Kima was staying. Also, I think somebody should run reconnaissance on Greyspine Manor.;Part I
287;287;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Like stealth, you mean?;Part I
288;288;LIAM;LIAM: Yes. I don't think we should try to go directly to the mines and find Nostoc.;Part I
289;289;LAURA;LAURA: No.;Part I
290;290;SAM;SAM: Agreed.;Part I
291;291;LIAM;LIAM: No, I think maybe we should enlist the help of a dwarf here in the city to introduce us to Nostoc. I mean, we're not trying to raise hell, or bring down a thousand dwarves upon us.;Part I
292;292;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: There's no sense attempting to be subtle.;Part I
293;293;SAM;SAM: Although, that does sound fun.;Part I
294;294;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Everyone's going to know that we're here, and what we're looking for by morning.;Part I
295;295;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Why don't we get old Drunky Greybeard that's got his face down on the bar to do it?;Part I
296;296;LAURA;LAURA: Yeah, but he's very– Well, let's ask him. Maybe he's drunk enough to help us. Saddle up, Grog!;Part I
297;297;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Me?;Part I
298;298;LAURA;LAURA: People seem to like you here.;Part I
299;299;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, but I'm really– oh, that's true.;Part I
300;300;LIAM;LIAM: You're the connoisseur.;Part I
301;301;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Maybe I'll part my armor, so he can see the scar. Post up on the bar.;Part I
302;302;MARISHA;MARISHA: Take him a drink!;Part I
303;303;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: All right.;Part I
304;304;LAURA;LAURA: Yes, take him a drink. A very large drink.;Part I
305;305;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I would like to get the largest goblet you have of ale, and I would like to go over to, what was his name? Bulbous?;Part I
306;306;MATT;MATT: Balgus.;Part I
307;307;ALL;ALL: Balgus.;Part I
308;308;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I had it right.;Part I
309;309;MATT;MATT: Close.;Part I
310;310;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Balgus. I would like to–;Part I
311;311;SAM;SAM: I'm coming with Grog.;Part I
312;312;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yes. I would like to go up and put my scar, and post up on the bar and (throat clearing);Part I
313;313;MATT;MATT: (snores);Part I
314;314;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: (louder throat clearing);Part I
315;315;SAM;SAM: I take out my flute and I play a little Healing Words spell and try to heal him of his drunkenness.;Part I
316;316;LAURA;LAURA: Just a little of his drunkenness, not all of his drunkenness.;Part I
317;317;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: He likes him drunk, so maybe like, half.;Part I
318;318;MATT;"MATT: You play your tune, a beautiful little tune that saunters through the air.The magical energies emanate from the notes you make, drift into his torso; you can see a slight glow and he, “(grumbling) Where's that blasted music coming from?” His hand goes out and paws towards the flute.";Part I
319;319;SAM;SAM: Huh, I don't know where that was coming from.;Part I
320;320;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I'm sorry to disturb you, your name is of great repute around these parts.;Part I
321;321;MATT;MATT: He wipes a globule of drool that's crusted into his beard. “Aye, you've bothered me nap. What do you want from Balgus?”;Part I
322;322;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We were wondering if we might, perchance, acquire your knowledge about town, for a bit of a search.;Part I
323;323;LAURA;LAURA: (whispered) Talk to him about fighting first.;Part I
324;324;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Right, I hear you're a good fighter. You look strong.;Part I
325;325;MATT;MATT: “I've heard the same.”;Part I
326;326;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Right. How often do you get challengers in this tavern?;Part I
327;327;MATT;MATT: “Not as often as I get woken up from my sleep. Which is never. Because only stupid people do that.”;Part I
328;328;LAURA;LAURA: Lost cause. Abandon ship!;Part I
329;329;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Right. I have an intelligence of six, I know what I'm doing.;Part I
330;330;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: There is a very pretty lady over there, with slightly pointy ears. (whispering) I'm;Part I
331;331;talking about you or you. (normal volume) There's two of them! They were actually wanting to ask you;talking about you or you. (normal volume) There's two of them! They were actually wanting to ask you;Part I
332;332;a question if you wouldn't mind.;a question if you wouldn't mind.;Part I
333;333;MATT;MATT: Make a persuasion roll.;Part I
334;334;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Me?!;Part I
335;335;SAM;SAM: Why is he doing this?;Part I
336;336;LAURA;LAURA: Why would you throw this to us?;Part I
337;337;MARISHA;MARISHA: I know!;Part I
338;338;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Because I was either going to fight him or I was going to throw boobs at him, and I went with boobs.;Part I
339;339;MARISHA;MARISHA: He realized he was sinking.;Part I
340;340;MATT;MATT: That's level ten you get that, by the way. Throw Boobs.;Part I
341;341;LAURA;LAURA: Persuasion. Oh! Good roll.;Part I
342;342;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Look at that: one. 19!;Part I
343;343;LAURA;LAURA: Woo!;Part I
344;344;MATT;MATT: 19? He takes a moment, and grabs the drink that you prepared from his hand and goes (gulps).;Part I
345;345;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Nice form.;Part I
346;346;MATT;MATT: “You've got five minutes.” Then he stretches his back a bit. This gnarled hunch that he holds in his physical posture, flexes it a bit, and now you can see the rippling muscles that show beneath his tunic. This is a built dwarf. You don't know what past he's had, moving boulders or forging crazy iron shit, but there's a reason this guy has a reputation. He stands up off of his stool, which you can now hear crack with the weight of a dwarf, which are made for normal dwarves. This guy is solid muscle. He saunters over, looks about for a second, almost like he's looking for his next target. Sees the pointy ears, sees the pointy ears, and goes (sighs) and saunters up to the table, slams his hand down.;Part I
347;347;MARISHA;MARISHA: Why is he coming towards us?;Part I
348;348;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Because I told him to. Because you're supposed to ask him–;Part I
349;349;SAM;SAM: Boobs!;Part I
350;350;LIAM;LIAM: Steady as she goes, ladies.;Part I
351;351;MATT;MATT: He sits down.;Part I
352;352;MARISHA;MARISHA: (whispered to Laura) You're better at this than I am.;Part I
353;353;MATT;MATT: “You called for Balgus, why?”;Part I
354;354;LAURA;LAURA: Oh! Hello, Balgus.;Part I
355;355;MARISHA;MARISHA: Hi, Balgus.;Part I
356;356;LAURA;LAURA: We just heard you're so impressive and masculine.;Part I
357;357;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yes!;Part I
358;358;LAURA;LAURA: We really wanted to talk to you.;Part I
359;359;ORION;ORION: I use my Earring of Whisper to Vex. Cool it down.;Part I
360;360;LAURA;LAURA: Oh sh– okay.;Part I
361;361;ORION;ORION: Calm down. Not so sexy.;Part I
362;362;MARISHA;MARISHA: I reach out and I stroke his bicep because I can't hear that.;Part I
363;363;ORION;ORION: Keyleth, stop doing that.;Part I
364;364;LIAM;LIAM: I disagree, heat it up.;Part I
365;365;LAURA;LAURA: Roll so good.;Part I
366;366;MARISHA;MARISHA: I'm really low in charisma. I'm really awkward. Persuasion.;Part I
367;367;MATT;MATT: Roll your persuasion.;Part I
368;368;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: (groans);Part I
369;369;LAURA;LAURA: Oh no, what was it?;Part I
370;370;MARISHA;MARISHA: I rolled a two?;Part I
371;371;MATT;MATT: Plus?;Part I
372;372;MARISHA;MARISHA: Plus my persuasion of zero, because I have a shitty charisma.;Part I
373;373;MATT;MATT: As your arm reaches for his bicep–;Part I
374;374;MARISHA;MARISHA: I didn't say anything. I just touched him!;Part I
375;375;MATT;MATT: As your arm reaches for his bicep, his hand, belying his grumpy, half-asleep haze– with unnatural speed reaches out and slaps your hand to the side. Not painfully, but just, “No touching the drunk dwarf.”;Part I
376;376;LAURA;LAURA: Sorry about my friend, Balgus. She's just so impressed with your muscles. We've heard amazing things about you here.;Part I
377;377;MATT;MATT: “Have you?”;Part I
378;378;LAURA;LAURA: We have.;Part I
379;379;MATT;MATT: Tell me, what have you heard?”;Part I
380;380;LAURA;LAURA: We've heard that no fighter can match your skill.;Part I
381;381;MATT;MATT: “You've heard correct.”;Part I
382;382;LAURA;LAURA: We've heard that you know more about this town than anyone else.;Part I
383;383;MATT;MATT: “I've been around a bit, yeah.”;Part I
384;384;LAURA;LAURA: Yeah. I bet nobody knows more about the Greyspines than you do and they've been around a long time.;Part I
385;385;MATT;MATT: “Political ass minds is what they are.”;Part I
386;386;SAM;SAM: Assmanes?;Part I
387;387;MATT;MATT: “Not keen to them– ass minds.”;Part I
388;388;MARISHA;MARISHA: Ass mines?;Part I
389;389;MATT;MATT: “They've got minds of an ass.”;Part I
390;390;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, I thought you meant like, mines that ex– Sorry. Go ahead. No, ass minds. Yes, they have ass minds.;Part I
391;391;MATT;MATT: “The Greyspines are no friend of mine. ”;Part I
392;392;LAURA;LAURA: No, I've heard they're terrible. What do you do, Balgus?;Part I
393;393;MATT;MATT: “What do I do? I own the brewery in town!”;Part I
394;394;LAURA;LAURA: (gasp) You do?;Part I
395;395;MATT;MATT: “The only one.”;Part I
396;396;LAURA;LAURA: The best brewery?;Part I
397;397;MATT;MATT: “The only! Of course it's the best!” I've put everyone out of business. We export to most of Tal'Dorei.“;Part I
398;398;LAURA;LAURA: This ale is amazing, that I'm drinking right now.;Part I
399;399;MATT;"MATT: ""Damn right it is!” You set it down and he takes it from your hand a little bit and takes a sip himself and sets it down again. (inhales deeply) (spits)";Part I
400;400;MARISHA;MARISHA: It seems that you aren't challenged often in business and in fighting.;Part I
401;401;ORION;ORION: I saunter over. Hello! My name is Tiberius Stormwind!;Part I
402;402;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We're all going to die.;Part I
403;403;MATT;MATT: He glances over and says, “Dragonborn. I haven't fought one of your kind in a long time.”;Part I
404;404;ORION;ORION: Oh! Who's the last dragonborn you fought? Do you remember his name?;Part I
405;405;MATT;MATT: “I recall his name was 'Broken and Bloody.'”;Part I
406;406;SAM;SAM: I think that's a friend of yours.;Part I
407;407;ORION;ORION: No, I know him! I know the Bloody family, they're terrible people. Anyway, my associates and I were wondering if you might come– Is that what we're doing? Trying to get him to come with us?;Part I
408;408;LAURA;LAURA: Anyway!;Part I
409;409;SAM;SAM: We're trying to find out more about Greyspine. Where he might be or who his associates might be.;Part I
410;410;MARISHA;MARISHA: Gee, I'm so glad you came over.;Part I
411;411;ORION;ORION: Would you like to accompany us on this journey that we're taking? We're trying to find the Greyspines and you seem like you would want to come in on this.;Part I
412;412;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We think there might be something rotten in the mines.;Part I
413;413;MATT;MATT: Make a persuasion roll. You can assist if you like.;Part I
414;414;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I'm assisting in this persuasion roll, good god.;Part I
415;415;MATT;MATT: That just means he has advantage.;Part I
416;416;ORION;ORION: Oh, I get advantage?;Part I
417;417;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: 21.;Part I
418;418;MATT;MATT: Yeah, so you get advantage on this roll.;Part I
419;419;SAM;SAM: So you roll twice.;Part I
420;420;MARISHA;MARISHA: What was the first thing you rolled?;Part I
421;421;ORION;ORION: Three. I'll take the 18.;Part I
422;422;MARISHA;MARISHA: Definitely take that 18.;Part I
423;423;ORION;ORION: Oh and plus my–;Part I
424;424;MARISHA;MARISHA: Persuasion.;Part I
425;425;MATT;MATT: He looks at you keenly, which–;Part I
426;426;ORION;ORION: Which is a nine.;Part I
427;427;LAURA;LAURA: Whoa, you have a nine persuasion?!;Part I
428;428;ORION;ORION: That's why I talk.;Part I
429;429;MARISHA;MARISHA: He's pretty charismatic.;Part I
430;430;MATT;MATT: He goes, “Well no, I don't really want to go anywhere with you. But if you're looking to go ahead and talk to the Greyspines, you don't want to go empty-handed. It's customary to come with a gift of some kind.”;Part I
431;431;LAURA;LAURA: Oh really?;Part I
432;432;SAM;SAM: What might they like?;Part I
433;433;MATT;MATT: “Well, let's just say, I have the finest brewery in the city.”;Part I
434;434;LAURA;LAURA: Oh!;Part I
435;435;MATT;MATT: “I have some fine, very rare, very exotic drinks that I could, perchance, sell to you.”;Part I
436;436;LIAM;LIAM: Pay the dwarf.;Part I
437;437;LAURA;LAURA: How much for this exotic ale?;Part I
438;438;MATT;MATT: “How exotic you wanting?”;Part I
439;439;LAURA;LAURA: We want to get in the door. We want him to like us.;Part I
440;440;MATT;MATT: “I can give you the finest of thistle branch, dark blood wine. This was crafted by myself, from a rare bloodthistle branch that I had brought over from the far-off city of Kamordah. This, I personally oversaw. It took me four years to fill this barrel full. It'll cost you 500 gold pieces. But it is a king's red wine!”;Part I
441;441;MARISHA;MARISHA: Can I do a persuasion check– a perception check to see if he's lying?;Part I
442;442;MATT;MATT: This would be insight. Go ahead and roll insight.;Part I
443;443;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I'm going to go walk over to Grog really quickly.;Part I
444;444;MARISHA;MARISHA: 27.;Part I
445;445;MATT;MATT: He seems too drunk to lie.;Part I
446;446;SAM;SAM: Let's just do it.;Part I
447;447;LAURA;LAURA: Tell you what, Balgus. We have some very rare items with us that I think you might be interested in.;Part I
448;448;MATT;MATT: “Make it quick! You've got one minute.”;Part I
449;449;LAURA;LAURA: We've got one minute? Well, we've got–;Part I
450;450;MATT;MATT: “My time is far worth the 500 gold you've already been talking about.”;Part I
451;451;LAURA;LAURA: We've got this with us right now.;Part I
452;452;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We've got a bunch of dragon pieces.;Part I
453;453;ORION;ORION: Do you like dragon pieces?;Part I
454;454;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We've got 37 dragon teeth, one dragon eye, four cups of dragon blood–;Part I
455;455;LAURA;LAURA: We've got this cup of dragon blood! Which I know can be added to ale or wine and makes it quite sensational.;Part I
456;456;MATT;MATT: He takes the sealed cup and sloshes it around in his hand. The actual liquid is coagulated to such a point that it's less of a blood and more of a gelatin. (sloshing sounds);Part I
457;457;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: It gets better with age.;Part I
458;458;LAURA;LAURA: Exactly, a spoon of it!;Part I
459;459;MATT;MATT: He peeks it open and (sniffs). “Yes!”;Part I
460;460;LAURA;LAURA: I think that's really expensive, actually.;Part I
461;461;MATT;MATT: “I can have this appraised, but if you want to do a straight trade for the barrel for this, I'll take you up on that.”;Part I
462;462;LAURA;LAURA: Shit, no.;Part I
463;463;SAM;SAM: Just go for it.;Part I
464;464;LAURA;LAURA: All right, fine! One cup of it.;Part I
465;465;MATT;MATT: “All right.” He takes the cup, puts it in a small satchel on his side. “Adra!” “Aye, what do you want, you drunken bastard?” “They've bought me thistle blood wine. Take it out back. Here's the key.” He tosses her the key. She grabs it and goes, “Really? Ooh, just walked in, they're buying fancy.” She comes back with two of her barmaiders who are begrudgingly carrying it with her. It's a nice barrel. It has a gold trim. The actual bands that hold the wood together is gold. The branding on the side is gold leafed into the wood. It's fine, exquisite, we're talking top shelf BevMo-style, awesome dwarven wine.;Part I
466;466;MARISHA;MARISHA: Top shelf at BevMo!;Part I
467;467;MATT;MATT: He pats it and he goes, “All yours. If this doesn't get you in the door, I'll eat my shoe.”;Part I
468;468;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Have you ever done that?;Part I
469;469;MATT;MATT: “Maybe, I forget a lot of nights.”;Part I
470;470;SAM;SAM: Where might that door be?;Part I
471;471;MATT;MATT: “Minute's up, you'll have to ask around, but it was great doing business with you.” He walks away from the table.;Part I
472;472;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I put it in the bag of holding.;Part I
473;473;MATT;MATT: It does not fit in the bag of holding.;Part I
474;474;LAURA and TRAVIS;LAURA and TRAVIS: What?!;Part I
475;475;MATT;MATT: The barrel is too big, you barely got Dork the ox in there. Which, for the record, they did fit a small ox in the bag of holding and then realized later on that there was no airflow.;Part I
476;476;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: He came out!;Part I
477;477;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I feel like we weren't going to discuss that. I felt that that was in the past.;Part I
478;478;MATT;MATT: I felt that was a necessary story.;Part I
479;479;SAM;SAM: Maybe if we drank some of it, it would fit.;Part I
480;480;LAURA;LAURA: The troll dick. Is that still in there or no?;Part I
481;481;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: No, we actually got rid of the troll dick.;Part I
482;482;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Did we trade the troll dick for something?;Part I
483;483;MARISHA;MARISHA: I thought we like used it as a weapon.;Part I
484;484;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I offered it up, but by that time it had turned into a slimy–;Part I
485;485;LAURA;LAURA: Ew.;Part I
486;486;MARISHA;MARISHA: I thought we threw it at somebody.;Part I
487;487;LAURA;LAURA: Can I stop Adra then and ask her where Greyspine Manor is? Keep, manor, whatever.;Part I
488;488;MATT;MATT: “Ah, well I can have him do it.” She pokes one of the barmaiders who turns around. This one's younger, he looks like he's frazzled and maybe new here or at least trying to make his way. He goes, “Okay, I can show you around, just follow me outside, come follow me.” He walks out. He's got a little apron on. He leads you guys outside. He brings you to the edge of the outer walkway of the central ring you're on. He points across the way and what you can see is a series of marble pillars that outline a residential district that opens and consumes the other side of the central ring of Kraghammer. He says, “If you go past far in that way, you'll look for the house of Greyspine. It's the one that has dark black marble with gold tinting inside the spiraling vein of the marble, it's gold. The gate outside is wrought iron, black iron, that's topped with a series of pikes and–” Pike awkwardly looks sickened, not understanding. “The real key point is, if you look on the front yard, you'll see a dwarven statue of the current Ironkeeper himself. That's where you'll want to go.”;Part I
489;489;SAM;SAM: Yes, very helpful, young man.;Part I
490;490;LAURA;LAURA: Thank you so much.;Part I
491;491;MATT;MATT: “Of course. If you get the chance, you could fill out a little form saying how helpful I've been–”;Part I
492;492;SAM;SAM: Are there suggestion cards here?;Part I
493;493;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, absolutely.;Part I
494;494;MATT;MATT: “Here.” He pulls out a small parchment and hands it to you. It's handwritten with a couple of checkboxes.;Part I
495;495;ORION;ORION: You should give us all a copy so you will have multiple.;Part I
496;496;MATT;MATT: “I only have one.”;Part I
497;497;ORION;ORION: Oh, okay, that's fine.;Part I
498;498;MATT;MATT: “Sorry!”;Part I
499;499;SAM;SAM: Confidence needs improvement.;Part I
500;500;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, it's okay, we have a wonderful writer.;Part I
501;501;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I'll rustle up a few. That's fine, why not. It's what I do, apparently.;Part I
502;502;MATT;MATT: He runs back into the tavern.;Part I
503;503;SAM;SAM: All right, shall we go to the manor?;Part I
504;504;LAURA;LAURA: Do we want to do the manor right now? What time is it?;Part I
505;505;SAM;SAM: 5:00 or 6:00.;Part I
506;506;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We got to sleep.;Part I
507;507;LAURA;LAURA: We might not want to bug him when he's, you know, having dinner.;Part I
508;508;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Let's be honest, that gate's going to jack us up. It's going to be full of trouble.;Part I
509;509;SAM;SAM: All right, yes, let's go sleep.;Part I
510;510;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Let's sleep.;Part I
511;511;LAURA;LAURA: Well, it's only 6:00.;Part I
512;512;SAM;SAM: Well, then we have time to do other things.;Part I
513;513;ORION;ORION: How long is a short rest?;Part I
514;514;MATT;MATT: Short rest is around ten minutes or so.;Part I
515;515;ORION;ORION: I want to take short rest.;Part I
516;516;MATT;MATT: You've technically been short resting in the tavern. It's more of like a post battle– like, take a breather, bandage your wounds, settle yourself after a harrowing experience. That's what a short rest is.;Part I
517;517;ORION;ORION: What was the arcane magic, the manor?;Part I
518;518;MATT;MATT: Oh, what you're looking for is the House Thunderbrand.;Part I
519;519;ORION;ORION: I want to head in that direction.;Part I
520;520;MATT;MATT: Okay, so you're dividing from the party? Okay.;Part I
521;521;ORION;ORION: Oh, I'm going to House Thunderbrand, if anybody wants to come with me.;Part I
522;522;LAURA;LAURA: What are you doing? I can't understand you with that popcorn in your mouth.;Part I
523;523;ORION;ORION: Sorry! I'm going to House Thunderbrand before turning in this evening. I've had a nice little short rest and I would like to ask them a few questions.;Part I
524;524;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, go ahead, okay.;Part I
525;525;SAM;SAM: Is there any recon that's going to happen tonight?;Part I
526;526;LAURA;LAURA: I think that you and I are going to go to Greyspine?;Part I
527;527;LIAM;LIAM: We'll check out the house.;Part I
528;528;SAM;SAM: Do you need any help?;Part I
529;529;LIAM;LIAM: Sure, you can come with us.;Part I
530;530;SAM;SAM: No, I don't want you to say yes.;Part I
531;531;LAURA;LAURA: Then no, we'll stealth our way.;Part I
532;532;LIAM;LIAM: Just a moment. Pike, you seem very distant. It's very strange, are you all right?;Part I
533;533;LAURA;LAURA: Pike's not listening, she's looking at the chat room.;Part I
534;534;SAM;SAM: She's feeling ill. Does she need to lie down?;Part I
535;535;MATT;MATT: Pike is feeling, and for those of you who are curious in the chat room, once again, elements of this are house ruled, so don't complain.;Part I
536;536;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, players.;Part I
537;537;MATT;MATT: We keep short rest to ten minutes because it makes it move faster. Pike is going along, she seems to be a little distracted, she can't quite understand. She says, “I don't know, I feel like I've been here before. It's hard to explain.”;Part I
538;538;MATT;MATT: “Anyway, I'm probably going to go rest for the evening.” She heads back to the tavern.;Part I
539;539;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: The fuck does that mean?;Part I
540;540;SAM;SAM: We'll find out next week.;Part I
541;541;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: But first, whores in the bedroom!;Part I
542;542;SAM;SAM: Grog and I go in search of a, shall we say politely, whorehouse.;Part I
543;543;MATT;MATT: The polite term.;Part I
544;544;LIAM;LIAM: Well, the cleric's away, the bard shall play.;Part I
545;545;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We need a massage. On my crotch.;Part I
546;546;LAURA;LAURA: You and I stealth.;Part I
547;547;MATT;MATT: You guys make your way to the Greyspine Manor, you guys head for that, you head to Thunderbrand.;Part I
548;548;SAM;SAM: Is Grog going to find someone his size?;Part I
549;549;MARISHA;MARISHA: Percy and I spend some time making some really nice comment cards for–;Part I
550;550;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We're going to make some beautiful comment cards.;Part I
551;551;MARISHA;MARISHA: For what's his name?;Part I
552;552;MATT;MATT: His name is Balan.;Part I
553;553;ALL;ALL: Balan.;Part I
554;554;MARISHA;MARISHA: We're going to make some wonderful comment cards for Balan.;Part I
555;555;LIAM;"LIAM: Oh, Percy is wonderful with calligraphy; you've shown me.";Part I
556;556;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Yes, thank you.;Part I
557;557;MATT;MATT: Okay, so you'll get to that. You guys do manage to find what's called The Stone's Pillow.;Part I
558;558;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: The Stone's Pillow?;Part I
559;559;MATT;MATT: The Stone's Pillow.;Part I
560;560;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I love it.;Part I
561;561;MATT;MATT: It's an establishment of comfort and ease, and will run you both for the evening, as you are not Kraghammer locals, 30 gold for the night each.;Part I
562;562;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: A bargain.;Part I
563;563;SAM;SAM: We'll take it.;Part I
564;564;LAURA;LAURA: 30 gold?!;Part I
565;565;SAM;SAM: What sort of ladies will we find there?;Part I
566;566;LAURA;LAURA: Bearded ladies.;Part I
567;567;SAM;SAM: What species?;Part I
568;568;MATT;MATT: The madam of the house introduces you to a spectrum of ladies, mostly dwarven, and very attractive, you know. This is a nice establishment. There is one gnome. One female gnome. There are a number of male dwarves as well, that are standing at the ready. There is one elf, looks a little shy and embarrassed that a goliath walked in.;Part I
569;569;SAM;SAM: And that's our choice.;Part I
570;570;MATT;MATT: Those are your choices.;Part I
571;571;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I'll take the tallest one.;Part I
572;572;SAM;SAM: I'll take a dwarf.;Part I
573;573;MATT;MATT: Okay. You choose your lady, you take the tallest one which would probably be the elf. As you walk in, the shy elf turns around entirely. She is aggressive and throws you around. You got your money's worth. You get manhandled in a way that you haven't– You're going to be sore in the morning.;Part I
574;574;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Thank you!;Part I
575;575;MATT;MATT: Welcome to Kraghammer, gentlemen.;Part I
576;576;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I like it already.;Part I
577;577;MATT;MATT: All right, you guys.;Part I
578;578;MATT;MATT: Are you just walking up to the manor?;Part I
579;579;LAURA;LAURA: No, we're going to try to check out what it looks like. See what the guards are like.;Part I
580;580;LIAM;LIAM: Yeah, we'll pretend to take a stroll.;Part I
581;581;LIAM;LIAM: Pose as a married couple.;Part I
582;582;LAURA;LAURA: Ew, no.;Part I
583;583;LIAM;LIAM: Just for the purposes of sneaking around the house.;Part I
584;584;LAURA;LAURA: (retching);Part I
585;585;LIAM;LIAM: I want to see what the area's like.;Part I
586;586;LAURA;LAURA: How about we pose as brother and sister, creepy?;Part I
587;587;LIAM;LIAM: You come on to every human, orc, and half-elf in the entire kingdom, but pretending to be my wife for 30 minutes is too much.;Part I
588;588;LAURA;LAURA: Yes. It's disgusting, so no.;Part I
589;589;LIAM;LIAM: You're probably right.;Part I
590;590;MATT;MATT: She's got standards.;Part I
591;591;LIAM;LIAM: Okay. So we'll take a stroll. Shop, see what the area's like.;Part I
592;592;MATT;MATT: You enter the residential district. It is dark and you see the red stone that permeates the area for a low gentle glow of the entire city is now clustered into these street lamps that are throughout the entire location. You begin to press into the residential district proper. There's some nice homes that are carved into the side of the rock, there's some stand-alone homes that are built out of fine stone. You eventually make your way towards the nicer part of it, where you start seeing some of the more marble buildings, some of the more exotic stonework being used in the construction of the homes. You also notice three of the guards that are part of the city establishment there are following you from behind, curiously. The Carvers.;Part I
593;593;LAURA;LAURA: Oh shit, the Carvers. Shit.;Part I
594;594;MATT;MATT: No weapons drawn, but definitely hands at the ready.;Part I
595;595;LAURA and LIAM;LAURA and LIAM: Okay.;Part I
596;596;LIAM;LIAM: Well, we could just keep walking.;Part I
597;597;LAURA;LAURA: We could, but that could be bad.;Part I
598;598;LIAM;LIAM: Yes. No, we just want to look at the house.;Part I
599;599;SAM;SAM: Louder!;Part I
600;600;LIAM;LIAM: I mean we're not going to go sneaking in in the day.;Part I
601;601;LAURA;LAURA: Let's say which ones are very obvious about being pretty, so we look like we're just sightseeing.;Part I
602;602;LIAM;LIAM: Yes.;Part I
603;603;MATT;MATT: (chuckles darkly) As you continue to walk, eventually some of the dwarves approach.;Part I
604;604;LAURA;LAURA: I point and say: Oh! Look at that one, with the carving, it's amazing!;Part I
605;605;LIAM;LIAM: The architecture is divine.;Part I
606;606;LAURA;LAURA: Divine!;Part I
607;607;SAM;SAM: (snorts) They're posing as the Howells?;Part I
608;608;LIAM;LIAM: Lovey, would you look at this dwarven home?;Part I
609;609;MATT;MATT: (snobby voice) The marble texture on this is gorgeous. You get about 20 more feet before you get, “Hail! Hail!”;Part I
610;610;LAURA;LAURA: Oh my! Yes? (giggles);Part I
611;611;MATT;MATT: “You foreigners are wandering too far in districts you don't belong to. What's your business?”;Part I
612;612;LAURA;LAURA: Oh I'm so sorry, I was just so amazed by the architecture here. I wanted to see the beautiful sculpture.;Part I
613;613;LIAM;LIAM: We definitely are visitors here, sir, no one has explained the rules to your city. We were just taking in the fantastic architecture and history of Kraghammer.;Part I
614;614;LAURA;LAURA: We were told there was a beautiful sculpture down the street of the ruler of Kraghammer?;Part I
615;615;MATT;MATT: Make a persuasion roll.;Part I
616;616;SAM;SAM: Oh jesus.;Part I
617;617;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh god.;Part I
618;618;MATT;MATT: Either of you, whichever you prefer.;Part I
619;619;SAM;SAM: If only I was there.;Part I
620;620;LAURA;LAURA: 21.;Part I
621;621;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Wow! Pretty decent, good for you.;Part I
622;622;MATT;"MATT: The guards look at each other. The one that was talking to you, you can see now, as he comes a little closer into the light, a frazzled black beard that's pulled into a very tight braid that goes down to his bellybutton. All wearing the same basic chest plate; long, black velvet cloak behind; each carrying some sort of heavy warhammer around the side of their belt. Steps up and says, “Well, just to tell you the rules here, if you're going to wander at night in a very expensive district, you don't want to do it by yourself because you either have chances of being mugged or arrested. We might have arrested you.”";Part I
623;623;LAURA;LAURA: Oh no! I'm so sorry! Well, do we need protection?;Part I
624;624;MATT;MATT: One of them looks over and sees the bear that is off in the shadows nearby.;Part I
625;625;LAURA;LAURA: I thought Trinket stayed behind. Cool, cool!;Part I
626;626;MATT;MATT: Trinket's quietly trying to keep up with his wonderful master.;Part I
627;627;LIAM;LIAM: Come along Trinket, there there's nothing to be scared of.;Part I
628;628;MATT;MATT: “What's a bear doing in Kraghammer?!” They all grab out their warhammers.;Part I
629;629;LAURA;LAURA: Oh no, please, he's quite harmless. In fact, he's very scared of most people.;Part I
630;630;LIAM;LIAM: He's completely trained. He does tricks. Doesn't he do tricks?;Part I
631;631;LAURA;LAURA: He does. Trinket show them your wonderful shake trick.;Part I
632;632;MATT;MATT: At which point Trinket, (subdued growling) just shakes his whole body. He looks at you, confused.;Part I
633;633;LAURA;LAURA: That's good.;Part I
634;634;MATT;MATT: Then raises a paw up, and– (bear noises);Part I
635;635;LAURA;LAURA: If you put your hand out, he'll shake your hand.;Part I
636;636;MATT;MATT: (growling);Part I
637;637;LAURA;LAURA: Yeah, see!;Part I
638;638;MATT;MATT: The dwarves take a step back as the claw goes through the, “That's all right. I would say if that's your animal–”;Part I
639;639;LAURA;LAURA: Yes?;Part I
640;640;MATT;MATT: “–don't bring it here.”;Part I
641;641;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, good to know. Trinket, head back to that tavern, would you? People are getting nervous.;Part I
642;642;MATT;MATT: (growling);Part I
643;643;LAURA;LAURA: I love you.;Part I
644;644;MATT;MATT: Trinket begins to walk back. A couple of other dwarves that are wandering carrying some packages to the side make a very wide berth around this armored bear that's slowly moping its way through the streets of Kraghammer. What could possibly go wrong?;Part I
645;645;LAURA;LAURA: He's so cute.;Part I
646;646;LIAM;LIAM: He's a sweetheart, he's fine.;Part I
647;647;MATT;MATT: (growls) You hear in the distance. The one goes like, “Look, I'll show you to the statue and that's it, then you got to go.”;Part I
648;648;LAURA;LAURA: All right. Thank you.;Part I
649;649;MATT;MATT: “I don't see many half-elves here and honestly I'm excited to meet you, so let's do this quickly. Come with me.” He leads you further into the cityscape. Down the road, you end up going through a few buildings. You find one large wrought iron fence with a series of carved spikes towards the top, and you see the beautiful dark marble building with the gold trim.;Part I
650;650;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, this one's amazing.;Part I
651;651;MATT;MATT: “This is what you were talking about, Greyspine Manor. Lot of rich sons of bitches.”;Part I
652;652;LAURA;LAURA: Wow, so you said the Greyspines own this one?;Part I
653;653;MATT;MATT: “Aye.”;Part I
654;654;LIAM;"LIAM: It's stunning. We only heard about the building itself; what can you tell us about the people who live here?";Part I
655;655;MATT;MATT: “Bunch of rich sons of bitches.”;Part I
656;656;LAURA;LAURA: Well, we can tell that can't we?;Part I
657;657;MATT;MATT: “Actually, Ironkeeper's all right, he's been doing a great job. The rest of the family can suck off.”;Part I
658;658;LIAM;LIAM: Not liked by the rest of the city, then?;Part I
659;659;MATT;MATT: “Oh, they have friends everywhere, but I personally don't like them. They run business pretty dark. They work most of their employees to the ground. To the bone.”;Part I
660;660;MATT;MATT: “I don't think that's how you run a business. Well, that's how you run a business for profit, but not for–”;Part I
661;661;LAURA;LAURA: Wow. It sounds like they would run the mithral mine which we've heard is so hard on its employees.;Part I
662;662;MATT;MATT: “Aye, that's the one.”;Part I
663;663;MATT;MATT: “Yeah. I don't know, I don't go that far south, doesn't interest me.;Part I
664;664;LIAM;LIAM: Nor us.;Part I
665;665;MATT;"MATT: ""Smells like brimstone.”";Part I
666;666;LAURA;LAURA: I don't blame you.;Part I
667;667;LIAM;LIAM: We prefer the company of good hard working people, like yourself. We're very impressed with the work the Carvers do in this city, from what little we've seen so far, so hats off to you.;Part I
668;668;MATT;MATT: “I appreciate that. You know it's not easy. You're born into it. We spend most of our time training, which can get very boring.” You see that two of the dwarves that are now about two steps behind go, “(clears throat) All right, Thompson! We got to get back to our post!” “Oh, sorry. Look, we've dillied about too much. Just follow us back, go about your business, don't wander here at night, and good luck.”;Part I
669;669;LAURA;LAURA: Thank you so much.;Part I
670;670;LIAM;LIAM: Thank you. We follow for a couple of blocks, behind them for a bit.;Part I
671;671;LAURA;LAURA: Make sure that they're paying attention to us.;Part I
672;672;MATT;MATT: Mm-hmm.;Part I
673;673;LIAM;LIAM: Yes.;Part I
674;674;MATT;MATT: All right. They bring you back towards the entrance of the residential district.;Part I
675;675;LAURA;LAURA: Then we stealth and–;Part I
676;676;LIAM;LIAM: – split off, yes, we can split off.;Part I
677;677;MATT;MATT: All right, roll stealth, both of you guys.;Part I
678;678;SAM;SAM: Am I currently being beaten by a whore dwarf or anything?;Part I
679;679;MATT;MATT: Make a constitution check!;Part I
680;680;SAM;SAM: Constitution check?;Part I
681;681;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Hang strong, buddy!;Part I
682;682;ORION;ORION: That's a mouthful. 'Whore dwarf.';Part I
683;683;SAM;SAM: 18!;Part I
684;684;MATT;MATT: Plus your constitution modifier. Actually, athletics! Go athletics!;Part I
685;685;SAM;SAM: Plus two! 20.;Part I
686;686;MATT;MATT: All right, that's a fine constitution check. You have impressed your female dwarf.;Part I
687;687;LIAM;LIAM: Are you making a sex check?;Part I
688;688;SAM;SAM: Yes! I'm sex checking.;Part I
689;689;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Whore dwarf!;Part I
690;690;MATT;MATT: That happened. That's the first time.;Part I
691;691;SAM;SAM: (grunting);Part I
692;692;LAURA;LAURA: This is so uncomfortable.;Part I
693;693;MATT;MATT: So that happened. What'd you guys roll for stealth?;Part I
694;694;LIAM;LIAM: 20.;Part I
695;695;LAURA;LAURA: He rolled a 20, I rolled a 15.;Part I
696;696;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: That's okay!;Part I
697;697;MATT;MATT: As you guys begin to wander off–;Part I
698;698;LAURA;LAURA: No! They're professional Carvers.;Part I
699;699;MATT;MATT: – Vax, you vanish. Vex, you take a couple steps. You hear, “Hey, hey, hey! I told you, it's dangerous down there in the dark! Don't do that!”;Part I
700;700;LAURA;LAURA: Of course!;Part I
701;701;MATT;MATT: “Where's your friend?”;Part I
702;702;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, he already went back to the tavern that we're staying at. I was wondering if maybe you could show me around the rest of the town?;Part I
703;703;MATT;MATT: He looks to the other guards and they're obviously fed up with his flirting, and they're not too keen on you guys. “Well, you guys hold up post, I'll give her a quick walk around.”;Part I
704;704;LAURA;LAURA: Thank you so much.;Part I
705;705;MATT;MATT: “All right, but I'm going to tell the boss!” “Fine! I don't get this chance very often!”;Part I
706;706;LIAM;LIAM: I wave off from the alley that I snuck in to.;Part I
707;707;LAURA;LAURA: Yeah, go do your shit.;Part I
708;708;LIAM;LIAM: You do your shit, that you do! Then I head back through the shadows.;Part I
709;709;LAURA;LAURA: Whoosh! Damn it!;Part I
710;710;MATT;MATT: You ask around, and it takes a while, especially since as a dragonborn some folks are like, “Oh, I'm not talking to you!” Some others are like, “Oh, yeah, right over that way!” It's a completely wrong direction, so it takes you a good two hours to eventually find your way to House Thunderbrand. When you get there, it's a beautiful alabaster building: large, white dome, with small spires built in to one of the more elevated ceilings of Kraghammer proper. On the outside, there is no gate, just an open lawn. You see grass, you see normally outside flora and fauna currently adorning the scape around this structure.;Part I
711;711;ORION;ORION: Whoa. Well, this is a lovely sight! I'm going to saunter on up to the door!;Part I
712;712;MATT;MATT: Nice! Go ahead and make a perception check.;Part I
713;713;ORION;ORION: Where is my perception–? Oh. Five.;Part I
714;714;MATT;MATT: Five? You saunter right up to the edge of the grass line, and get one step on what suddenly becomes visible to you: a rather subtly carved dwarven rune in the ground. In fact, there's a bunch of them, outlining the entirety of the grass. As your foot hits the rune, you're like, “Oh, that's a dwarven rune!” (stomping);Part I
715;715;SAM;SAM: That's a good voice!;Part I
716;716;MATT;MATT: (as Tiberius) I've been practicing my Tiberius.;Part I
717;717;ORION;ORION: It's close.;Part I
718;718;MATT;MATT: Go ahead and roll a dexterity saving throw.;Part I
719;719;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Uh-oh. Saving throw?;Part I
720;720;LAURA;LAURA: You got it, Tiberius!;Part I
721;721;ORION;ORION: What is this?;Part I
722;722;MARISHA;MARISHA: Dexterity.;Part I
723;723;ORION;ORION: Oh! That's a 15.;Part I
724;724;MATT;MATT: 15?;Part I
725;725;ORION;ORION: Mm-hmm.;Part I
726;726;MATT;MATT: You manage to pull back to lessen the impact, but a bolt of bluish energy bursts out from the rune in front of you, throwing you about three or four feet behind the rune. You catch yourself. You do suffer eight points of thunder damage.;Part I
727;727;MARISHA;MARISHA: Damn gated communities.;Part I
728;728;SAM;SAM: This is why we go to brothels instead of sneaking around at night!;Part I
729;729;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yep! No lightning attacks!;Part I
730;730;MATT;MATT: It's a whole different kind of damage you can suffer!;Part I
731;731;ORION;ORION: Okay. Well, I dust myself off. Apparently, there's some security. Hello?! Anything happen?;Part I
732;732;MATT;MATT: You wait about two or three minutes, no response.;Part I
733;733;ORION;ORION: Two to three minutes? That's a long time.;Part I
734;734;MARISHA;MARISHA: I have a feeling they're not going to respond to the crazy guy.;Part I
735;735;ORION;ORION: Very well.;Part I
736;736;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: What're you two doing?;Part I
737;737;TALIESIN and MARISHA;TALIESIN and MARISHA: We're making comment cards! Yes!;Part I
738;738;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: You're all going to have comment cards that you are expected to fill out when you return back to the bar!;Part I
739;739;SAM;SAM: Hugely important!;Part I
740;740;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yes, because– what was it? Baldus, Beldus?;Part I
741;741;SAM;SAM: Balgus?;Part I
742;742;MARISHA;MARISHA: Balan! Balan was so nice!;Part I
743;743;MATT;MATT: There we go. Balgus and Balan.;Part I
744;744;ORION;ORION: What do I see around the place? Do I see any large rocks, or any large pillars that I can–?;Part I
745;745;MATT;MATT: Best from what you can tell at this distance, because it's fairly dark down here: the building itself has four corner spires around the large central dome structure. Each one of these spires is a very thin, tall, alabaster spire that at the very top is crested with some sort of bluish crystal that comes to a point. They're probably a good 35, 40 feet tall. About as tall as the rest of the structure is. You can't really tell how far back the structure goes because it meets with the back of the cave wall.;Part I
746;746;ORION;ORION: I'm going to– okay. I'm going to shoot a Fireball. Right in front of me, roll it like a bowling ball. Just right to the door.;Part I
747;747;SAM;SAM: There's a baby right there.;Part I
748;748;MATT;MATT: You are four feet from the door.;Part I
749;749;ORION;ORION: Oh! I'm four feet from the door? I don't do that.;Part I
750;750;MATT;MATT: You can step back and do it.;Part I
751;751;ORION;ORION: I'm only four feet from the door? Oh.;Part I
752;752;MATT;MATT: It pushed you back four feet from the rune you stepped on. You're not at the door.;Part I
753;753;LAURA;LAURA: Can I use that magical earring that we have?;Part I
754;754;LIAM;LIAM: You don't know what's going on there!;Part I
755;755;SAM;SAM: Episode one. Tiberius kills himself.;Part I
756;756;MARISHA;MARISHA: Don't die! I should have come with you! Then I could–;Part I
757;757;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Bowl that Fireball, dude!;Part I
758;758;MATT;MATT: Tiberius Stormwind is a dragonborn sorcerer. Everyone is level nine currently in the game.;Part I
759;759;ORION;ORION: I use Mage Hand. I knock on the door.;Part I
760;760;MATT;MATT: From that far away? Okay, the arcane energy swirls up and forms this loosely hand-like appendage that drifts forward. As soon as it crosses over the rune where you stepped on, there is a spark of energy and the hand is dispelled.;Part I
761;761;ORION;ORION: Damn these runes. Okay, fine. I will do Glacial Blast right up to the door.;Part I
762;762;ORION;ORION: But not to the door.;Part I
763;763;MARISHA;MARISHA: What?;Part I
764;764;SAM;SAM: You're alone.;Part I
765;765;MATT;MATT: Okay. You cast the Glacial Blast forward. The ice begins to congeal across the bottom of the floor. As it reaches the front of the rune, there is another spark of energy and the ice forms up against an invisible barrier that's there and then the ice that's up against the barrier melts extremely quickly, drifting into a puddle of water.;Part I
766;766;ORION;ORION: Shit. I turn back and head to the group.;Part I
767;767;MATT;MATT: Okay. As you turn around there are four Carvers that are hurrying towards you now, with their hammers out going, “You!”;Part I
768;768;ORION;ORION: What?!;Part I
769;769;MATT;MATT: They all surround you on all sides, you have a dwarf on each corner. “You have attacked one of the great dwarven families of Kraghammer! Name yourself and your business before you are under arrest.”;Part I
770;770;ORION;ORION: Don't speak to me in that manner, I am Tiberius Stormwind!;Part I
771;771;SAM;SAM: I am snoring after having sex.;Part I
772;772;MATT;MATT: Make intimidation check.;Part I
773;773;ORION;ORION: 18.;Part I
774;774;MATT;MATT: All four Carvers take a step back, look at each other. “Look, we're just doing our job. What's your business?”;Part I
775;775;ORION;ORION: I understand that, and I am sorry for losing my temper. I was just looking to ask questions of particular artifacts I have been looking for and this house is the only known arcane house I know that I was pointed to. I tried to reach them and communicate, but I was stopped by the stupid rune I can't figure out! I was turning back to get my tavern to get some rest and come back and try to contact the family the next day! Then I was stopped by you!;Part I
776;776;ORION;ORION: 24.;Part I
777;777;LIAM;LIAM: I've just arrived to New York City, I'm going to smash the doors open.;Part I
778;778;MATT;MATT: The dwarf guards look at each other and one of them steps forward and this guy you can see now he has more carvings in his armor, he looks to have a little more rank than the other ones. He steps forward, ruddy brown beard, his eyes itself are pitch black. There is almost no color to the irises. He goes, “Look. I'm letting you off this once, but if you so much as spit in the direction of any other dwarf in the city, we're going to bury you so far underneath the dungeon you won't see the light of day 'til the day you rot, you hear me, dragonborn?”;Part I
779;779;ORION;ORION: I mean yes, my hearing is perfectly fine.;Part I
780;780;MATT;MATT: “Get on with you.” He puts his hammer back at his side. They all separate, stare you down as you walk past.;Part I
781;781;ORION;ORION: Good day. Back to the tavern.;Part I
782;782;MATT;MATT: Okay. You!;Part I
783;783;LIAM;LIAM: Yes?;Part I
784;784;MATT;MATT: You make your way through the alleyways, eventually back towards the building proper. What would you like to do?;Part I
785;785;LIAM;LIAM: Just going to watch, that's all. Do I see any security details? See who's guarding the place.;Part I
786;786;MATT;MATT: There are Carvers doing rounds around the city. On the streets wandering through in pairs, keeping watch. You don't see any particular guard outside, but you do see individuals moving past windows. There's a little bit of light from the inside of the buildings.;Part I
787;787;LIAM;LIAM: No Carvers or any sort of guard detail outside the house? Anything like that?;Part I
788;788;MATT;MATT: Not between the gates. The yard area and to the front door.;Part I
789;789;LIAM;LIAM: Okay. Heavily heavily guarded by the looks of what's inside and what's outside the gate?;Part I
790;790;MATT;MATT: What's outside the gate? You're hard pressed to find a moment where the street isn't visible to some Carver. This area is pretty well guarded. You figure largely because the person who is currently the Ironkeeper of the entire city of Kraghammer lives within that building as well as one of the more powerful dwarven families, so it's pretty well watched.;Part I
791;791;LIAM;LIAM: Okay, I'm going to head back to the inn, then. I'm not going to poke the bear.;Part I
792;792;MATT;MATT: You all eventually gather back at the tavern.;Part I
793;793;SAM;SAM: (exhausted sigh) How was your night?;Part I
794;794;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: That was wonderful, I don't know about you!;Part I
795;795;SAM;SAM: (singsong) I have hickies.;Part I
796;796;LIAM;LIAM: Hickies? Is that a Gnomish STD?;Part I
797;797;SAM;SAM: Yes.;Part I
798;798;LAURA;LAURA: Crazy! I have some hickies too, actually. What?;Part I
799;799;SAM;SAM: What?;Part I
800;800;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We have comment cards, so this will all work out well.;Part I
801;801;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yes! here! Here you go, here you go–;Part I
802;802;SAM;SAM: Success all around! Did you learn anything, Vex and Vax?;Part I
803;803;LIAM;LIAM: I definitely think we should take the diplomacy route. The place is heavily guarded. There seem to be lots of Carvers.;Part I
804;804;MATT;MATT: There's a knock at the room that you guys are currently talking in.;Part I
805;805;LAURA;LAURA: Yes?;Part I
806;806;MATT;MATT: Unless, are you in the tavern proper or have you gone back to– ?;Part I
807;807;LAURA;LAURA: No, we're in a room.;Part I
808;808;SAM;SAM: I'll get it! (clears throat) Hello?;Part I
809;809;MATT;MATT: Adra's standing there looking a little nervous and she goes, “Hi, sorry to bother you. Is that bear one of yours?”;Part I
810;810;LAURA;LAURA: Yes! Trinket! Isn't he adorable?;Part I
811;811;MATT;MATT: “You might want to go,” You hear in the tavern: (aggravated growls);Part I
812;812;LAURA;LAURA: I'll be right back. I head downstairs.;Part I
813;813;MATT;MATT: You head downstairs and you can see all the dwarves are now gathered around the fighting ring in the center of the tavern.;Part I
814;814;MATT;MATT: Trinket's now inside the ring with a couple other dwarves around, prodding and pushing it into the ring.;Part I
815;815;LAURA;LAURA: No, no! No! No.;Part I
816;816;MATT;MATT: There's raucous cheering. They're not even listening to you at this point.;Part I
817;817;LAURA;LAURA: Grog!;Part I
818;818;LIAM;LIAM: I followed my sister downstairs.;Part I
819;819;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I come down too. It's party time!;Part I
820;820;MARISHA;MARISHA: I run down to with Grog.;Part I
821;821;MATT;MATT: Okay, as you guys head down, you can see now Balgus is now up and rubbing his chin. “Oh, never fought a bear before! (laughs)”;Part I
822;822;LAURA;LAURA: No, Balgus! Fuck! Trinket, come here! Are we allowed to cuss? Trinket, come here!;Part I
823;823;MATT;MATT: You are very much allowed to cuss.;Part I
824;824;MATT;MATT: Isn't that right, guys? Fuck yeah!;Part I
825;825;LAURA;LAURA: No, no, and I run into the ring with him.;Part I
826;826;MATT;MATT: Okay, as you run into the ring a couple of the dwarves pat you on the back, you get a shove into the ring. It's now Trinket and you–;Part I
827;827;LAURA;LAURA: Oh! I'll take on this bear!;Part I
828;828;SAM;SAM: What?!;Part I
829;829;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Well, all right!;Part I
830;830;MATT;MATT: Make a general charisma check.;Part I
831;831;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Do it! Fuck that bear up!;Part I
832;832;LIAM;LIAM: I'm pushing my way through the crowd.;Part I
833;833;MATT;MATT: What did you roll?;Part I
834;834;LIAM;LIAM: A one.;Part I
835;835;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh no!;Part I
836;836;MATT;MATT: Yes!;Part I
837;837;LIAM;LIAM: First one of the series, everybody! First one!;Part I
838;838;MATT;MATT: As you rush and you guys are coming to the front, Balgus sees this and now you can see both eyes are open which means he's sobered up a bit, and he goes, “Oh no! This bear's mine. You want to fight two of us? Oh, it'll wake you right up!”;Part I
839;839;LAURA;LAURA: Let's do it!;Part I
840;840;MATT;MATT: “Nothing as invigorating as a brawl!”;Part I
841;841;SAM;SAM: Are you going to fucking fight him?;Part I
842;842;MARISHA;MARISHA: I cast a fog. Over the ring.;Part I
843;843;MATT;MATT: Okay. As everyone is cheering up and getting ready, this very thick fog begins to fill the center of the bar area. You can now see a bunch of people are, “Wait, what the?!” Some are coughing. Some are like, “What the hell's going on? Fucking hell. Why is there–”;Part I
844;844;MARISHA;MARISHA: Okay, I run up in the fog, and I tap Trinket and I whisper in Trinket's ear and I say: Trinket, I'm tapping you out. And I turn into a bear like Trinket!;Part I
845;845;SAM;SAM: What?!;Part I
846;846;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Good!;Part I
847;847;MARISHA;MARISHA: Wait. First, I Polymorph Trinket into a squirrel.;Part I
848;848;LAURA;LAURA: (gasp) You can do that?;Part I
849;849;MARISHA;MARISHA: I can. No, a mouse, like a rat.;Part I
850;850;LAURA;LAURA: Little tiny.;Part I
851;851;MATT;MATT: Okay. You see the shadows nearby the fog you hear, “Come at me, I'm going to–” You can see Balgus's shadow swinging wildly at the air, angrily.;Part I
852;852;SAM;SAM: Are you going to fight him?;Part I
853;853;LAURA;LAURA: I don't know!;Part I
854;854;MATT;MATT: You grab Trinket. Trinket shrinks down into a tiny little mouse.;Part I
855;855;MARISHA;MARISHA: I say: Scanlan! Catch Trinket!;Part I
856;856;SAM;SAM: Jesus, I don't like rats, but I'll keep it. Okay.;Part I
857;857;MATT;MATT: Trinket, the little mouse face, the moment you see it, looks very confused, very scared.;Part I
858;858;SAM;SAM: It's okay. I'll protect it. Don't worry.;Part I
859;859;MARISHA;MARISHA: Then I bear form up.;Part I
860;860;MATT;MATT: You (whoosh) into a bear form. Now Keyleth is now this giant bear where Trinket once was.;Part I
861;861;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I got my money on Ballsack!;Part I
862;862;SAM;SAM: Don't bet against the enemy!;Part I
863;863;LIAM;LIAM: In the fog I somersault over some random dwarf and pull out my dagger, but turn it around in my hand and whack Balgus in the back of the head as hard as I can, just to try and knock him out.;Part I
864;864;LAURA;LAURA: Can you see in fog?;Part I
865;865;SAM;SAM: He's a really good fighter.;Part I
866;866;LIAM;LIAM: Low light.;Part I
867;867;MATT;MATT: Go ahead and make a stealth check.;Part I
868;868;MATT;MATT: You have advantage because you are in fog.;Part I
869;869;ORION;ORION: I'm at the balcony by the way. Watching all this.;Part I
870;870;LAURA;LAURA: You have advantage, roll twice.;Part I
871;871;LIAM;LIAM: Oh, thank you.;Part I
872;872;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, we're watching what they're doing.;Part I
873;873;SAM;SAM: Remember, he's our friend. We don't want to kill him.;Part I
874;874;ORION;ORION: I'm taking a short rest, you all can do this.;Part I
875;875;LIAM;LIAM: 21.;Part I
876;876;MATT;MATT: Okay. Balgus's drunken, mist covered state does not seem to notice your approach. He is swinging wildly, though. He has disadvantaged attack on you as you approach. One of his fists swings past you. That is going to be a 12, I don't think that hits.;Part I
877;877;LIAM;LIAM: No.;Part I
878;878;MATT;MATT: You just narrowly dodge out of the way. You can feel the fist just whoosh past one of your;Part I
879;879;ears. As you come back up, clutching the base of your dagger, go for your strike.;ears. As you come back up, clutching the base of your dagger, go for your strike.;Part I
880;880;LAURA;LAURA: Oh my gosh!;Part I
881;881;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Come on taint butter, you got it.;Part I
882;882;LIAM;LIAM: Oh, that's no good. Oh, I have advantage on the attack roll for this?;Part I
883;883;MATT;MATT: Because he does not see you, yes. You are currently stealthed.;Part I
884;884;LIAM;LIAM: That's much better. 26!;Part I
885;885;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: That'll work.;Part I
886;886;MATT;MATT: That'll hit. Go ahead and roll sneak attack damage on this, of course.;Part I
887;887;LIAM;LIAM: Plus regular?;Part I
888;888;SAM;SAM: Don't kill him!;Part I
889;889;MATT;MATT: Well, we're considering it nonlethal damage because it's with the base of the dagger.;Part I
890;890;ORION;ORION: I'm having an ale while watching all this.;Part I
891;891;MATT;MATT: You're watching a lot of fog, with some shapes moving in it.;Part I
892;892;ORION;ORION: Yeah, and I'm like: This is fog! Probably Keyleth's spell.;Part I
893;893;LAURA;LAURA: I'm blindly looking for Trinket.;Part I
894;894;SAM;SAM: Trinket's in my hands.;Part I
895;895;MATT;MATT: You're like, “Where's Trinket?” You see a giant bear there and you're like, “There's Trinket! That's not Trinket. There's no armor.”;Part I
896;896;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, that's right.;Part I
897;897;MATT;MATT: You're very confused. Trinket now has no armor, is a slightly different shade–;Part I
898;898;MARISHA;MARISHA: No, he's close enough! Man, come on, I've been around Trinket enough.;Part I
899;899;ORION and MARISHA;ORION and MARISHA: Come on, man!;Part I
900;900;LIAM;LIAM: 27, right in the base of his skull.;Part I
901;901;MATT;MATT: Crack! A resounding impact hits and there now dwarves that are like, “Yeah! Ooh!” All the cheering stops and there's this lull. Quiet hits. Balgus hasn't moved, by the way. You impact and it's like hitting a wall. There's this taut, thick stump of muscle where the dwarf neck is.;Part I
902;902;LIAM;LIAM: Fuck!;Part I
903;903;MATT;MATT: As you pull back the dagger, his hand reaches up and grabs your wrist. His head slowly turns towards you and he goes, (laughs);Part I
904;904;LIAM;LIAM: Bonus action to disengage. Disengage as a rogue.;Part I
905;905;MATT;MATT: Well he's going to attempt to grapple you.;Part I
906;906;LAURA and LIAM;LAURA and LIAM: Oh no.;Part I
907;907;MATT;"MATT: Go ahead and make an acrobatics check; it's probably your best score anyway.";Part I
908;908;LIAM;LIAM: All right. Oh, that's fine! That's a 30.;Part I
909;909;MATT;MATT: That's a 30?;Part I
910;910;LIAM;LIAM: Yeah.;Part I
911;911;MATT;MATT: You manage to just slip out of his grip. Barely. He was about to clamp on. As you step away, he turns towards you and goes, “Oh, well I feel alive tonight! Bring it, all of you! I want to smash a face in.” He's got a little bit of ale froth at the corner of his mouth. It's beginning to drip into his beard. It's quite an awful sight for those that are close enough to see it. The rest of you just see this, shapes and movement. There's still this, “Okay, what's going on?” kind of a feel. You hear Adra in the back going, “Stop this! This is– I can't even see! What are you doing?! Don't destroy another table!” She's frantically trying to stop this chaos. There's now a bear– what are you doing, Keyleth?;Part I
912;912;MARISHA;MARISHA: I'm a bear and–;Part I
913;913;MATT;MATT: You're a bear.;Part I
914;914;ORION;ORION: (like Marisha) I'm a bear.;Part I
915;915;MARISHA;MARISHA: What happened?;Part I
916;916;MATT;MATT: You're a bear, you want to do anything?;Part I
917;917;LAURA;LAURA: What are you doing?;Part I
918;918;MATT;MATT: You see the shape of Balgus like– in the middle of this fight ring.;Part I
919;919;LAURA;LAURA: Do some tricks! Do some tricks! Start clapping and, like, dancing around.;Part I
920;920;MARISHA;MARISHA: Okay, that's a good idea.;Part I
921;921;MATT;MATT: This is what she tells you.;Part I
922;922;MARISHA;MARISHA: I see her as my trainer.;Part I
923;923;LAURA;LAURA: Dance!;Part I
924;924;MARISHA;MARISHA: I'm like (growling). I'm circus bear-ing.;Part I
925;925;LAURA;LAURA: Everyone! Gather round and watch the amazing Trinket do his tricks!;Part I
926;926;SAM;SAM: I start playing music from my shawm instrument. Which exists.;Part I
927;927;MATT;MATT: Yeah, it does.;Part I
928;928;SAM;SAM: A rousing jaunty bear-like tune.;Part I
929;929;ORION;ORION: I'm going to cast Prestidigitation and do fireworks on top of that.;Part I
930;930;MARISHA;MARISHA: You should give me a fez! Can you Prestidigitation me a fez?;Part I
931;931;ORION;ORION: Can I do little hats?;Part I
932;932;MATT;MATT: You haven't done a fez yet. You need to work on that. A couple more levels.;Part I
933;933;ORION;ORION: No. I'll try. Paper hat!;Part I
934;934;MATT;MATT: Have you ever seen fireworks go off in a cloud? You get that little boof, boof. There's a bunch of that above you. Cloud, lights flashing. You begin singing your tune. Do you give an inspiration dice to her?;Part I
935;935;SAM;SAM: Sure, I would love to give her an inspiration dice.;Part I
936;936;MATT;MATT: A d8 inspiration dice from the bard as you hear the enchanting, jaunty, bear dancing theme.;Part I
937;937;SAM;SAM: (singing) Oh, look over there! It's a bear! Yeah!;Part I
938;938;MATT;MATT: Bard getting his bard on. Go ahead and make a performance check.;Part I
939;939;SAM;SAM: Who, me?;Part I
940;940;MATT;MATT: No, she does. You're performing as a bear!;Part I
941;941;MARISHA;MARISHA: Natural 20!;Part I
942;942;MATT;MATT: Do you want to add performance dice?;Part I
943;943;LIAM;LIAM: Look at that, a fucking bear dance.;Part I
944;944;MATT;MATT: I'm sorry, the inspiration dice that he gave you.;Part I
945;945;SAM;SAM: No! It's a natural 20!;Part I
946;946;MARISHA;MARISHA: It's a natural 20!;Part I
947;947;MATT;MATT: I know. Okay!;Part I
948;948;MARISHA;MARISHA: No, I want to save it! I'm inspired, for later. I will think back to that moment.;Part I
949;949;MATT;MATT: You were so inspired, you weren't even inspired to be inspired for this.;Part I
950;950;MATT;"MATT: This array of strange puffy fireworks in the fog; you doing this little rotation. You actually manage to do a bear cartwheel, and slam into the ring, but it looks pretty cool. You get back up. You're on your hind legs, you dance on one foot for a second. Balgus is like, (raucous laughter). He starts laughing, doubles over, clutching his stomach, laughing his ass off. Other dwarves start laughing too. The music gets louder and the band in the back of the tavern begins playing again. There's now this general jovial air restored to the tavern.";Part I
951;951;LAURA;LAURA: I grab an empty cup off of the table and say: Tips for the bear, right here!;Part I
952;952;SAM;SAM: We're going to get money for this?;Part I
953;953;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Of course.;Part I
954;954;LIAM;LIAM: I beeline to the bar and say: A large mug of ale, please. As soon as it's ready, bring it right over to Balgus.;Part I
955;955;MATT;MATT: You guys are pulling through a crowd, covered in mist still. You're having a hard time finding your way through the bar. The people are at least now cheering, in the mood. There's still some people trying to find their way to the front to see what's going because they hear the music and they hear the cheering. “Well, what's going on over there?” They're pushing their way through. You make your way to the bar. You see Adra's really nervous, like, (panicked sounds);Part I
956;956;LIAM;LIAM: I can fix this!;Part I
957;957;MATT;MATT: “How? Do! Go!”;Part I
958;958;LIAM;LIAM: Quickly?;Part I
959;959;MATT;MATT: “Here, go!” She hands you one, doesn't even charge you for it.;Part I
960;960;MARISHA;MARISHA: I'm still dancing!;Part I
961;961;LIAM;LIAM: Looking for Balgus in the crowd.;Part I
962;962;MATT;MATT: He's still in the center of the ring. No one's still getting near Balgus. They're cheering off to the side. Balgus is laughing. “Ooh, growl for me! Do a happy growl!”;Part I
963;963;MARISHA;MARISHA: (growls);Part I
964;964;MATT;MATT: “Yeah, there's a happy growl! Oh, it's been so long since I've been outside!” A little tear on the edge of his face. As you approach up his side–;Part I
965;965;LIAM;LIAM: Arm around his shoulder.;Part I
966;966;MATT;MATT: Immediately, instinctively, he slaps it off his arm and turns around.;Part I
967;967;LIAM;LIAM: Take this! You are an impressive specimen, my good man. I have never had a fight that amazing in at least a week. That was something to see. Here, take this, and after this one there's three more.;Part I
968;968;MATT;MATT: He's drunk, you're offering him ale, and he's been laughing at a bear for two minutes. Make a persuasion roll with advantage.;Part I
969;969;LIAM;LIAM: Yeah! Persuasion, you say? 15.;Part I
970;970;MATT;MATT: Two rolls, yeah, you have advantage.;Part I
971;971;LIAM;LIAM: Oh! 15.;Part I
972;972;MATT;MATT: 15! He looks at you with this big grin, and you can now see his gnarled, yellow dwarven teeth, this railroad of terror that his mouth is. This big smile. He reaches out, his beard poofing over the side, grabs it and goes, “See, now this is dwarven hospitality!” He lifts his drink up and it spills a little bit on his arm. He's like, “Hey!” Everyone lifts up and cheers again.;Part I
973;973;MATT;MATT: Everyone still keeps drinking through the fog. It's like a bad sauna in here right now. Everyone's fighting their way through. At which point now, Balgus slaps you on the shoulder, takes a drink, and wanders out of the fight ring, goes and finds a table to sit down and begin chugging what you gave him.;Part I
974;974;SAM;SAM: Why don't we adjourn for the evening? Retire to our rooms?;Part I
975;975;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Why don't you go change out of bear form?;Part I
976;976;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yeah, and I guess I can let Trinket change out of mouse form.;Part I
977;977;SAM;SAM: Why don't you wait until we're upstairs?;Part I
978;978;LAURA;LAURA: Can I take the mouse? Can I take Trinket?;Part I
979;979;SAM;SAM: Here, rat-mouse-thing.;Part I
980;980;LAURA;LAURA: Okay, hi, Trinket! Oh, is his armor teeny tiny too?;Part I
981;981;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, does he have a tiny armor mouse? Mouse armor!;Part I
982;982;MATT;MATT: If you choose, while polymorphing him, you could make it as a visual aesthetic. Because it was a quick impact, I would say it looks like a normal mouse right now. Sorry. Next time!;Part I
983;983;LAURA;LAURA: Well you're still adorable little– don't poke him.;Part I
984;984;MATT;MATT: (squeaks);Part I
985;985;LAURA;LAURA: I stick him in my little pocket.;Part I
986;986;LIAM;LIAM: I grab a half a mug of ale off the table and say, “Dwarven compatriots, we could not have expected a better welcome here in Kraghammer! We'll see you tomorrow night for round two. Thank you, one and all.”;Part I
987;987;ALL;ALL: Huzzah!;Part I
988;988;MATT;MATT: (cheering) Balgus goes, “Three more! You said three more!” You see his empty cup on the table.;Part I
989;989;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We did say three more.;Part I
990;990;LAURA;LAURA: I laugh and hustle her over and say: One, two, three, put them in a row for this gentleman right here.;Part I
991;991;MATT;MATT: “Aye! (whispers) Thanks.” She gives you like a really earnest like, “Thank you.” You now have a very good idea of how a good third of the tables in this tavern are repaired.;Part I
992;992;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: He's tough.;Part I
993;993;MATT;MATT: You guys head back up to the rooms.;Part I
994;994;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: You put some stank on him.;Part I
995;995;MATT;MATT: Yeah, that was like a (vibrating) when you got the impact on him.;Part I
996;996;LAURA;LAURA: Don't fight him, you guys.;Part I
997;997;SAM;SAM: Oh, Grog's going to fight him at some point.;Part I
998;998;MATT;MATT: I get the feeling that's probably going to go down at some point.;Part I
999;999;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: He's going to be playmates with me.;Part I
1000;1000;LIAM;LIAM: It's just a misunderstanding. I'm sure he's a lovely gentleman.;Part I
1001;1001;MATT;MATT: You guys are heading back up to the room. Which, it's not a hallway built for a bear. Your shoulders are squeezing through.;Part I
1002;1002;LAURA;LAURA: How big is the room?;Part I
1003;1003;MATT;MATT: Well, each one of your rooms comfortably fits two people, maybe. Like, one and a half?;Part I
1004;1004;LAURA;LAURA: Oh no. What will I do with Trinket?;Part I
1005;1005;MATT;MATT: If you help push Trinket through the door. Thankfully, dwarves are fairly wide folk, so the doors are built for stouter folk, they're just not very tall. You, actually, have to bend through, Grog, to get into your room. On the bed that you lie on, your legs dangle a good two feet off the bottom, at maximum. You can push Trinket through with a one, two, three! Or you can carry her through as a mouse, and then have her stuck in there.;Part I
1006;1006;LIAM;LIAM: That's all right. Neither of us need a blanket now.;Part I
1007;1007;LAURA;LAURA: Well.;Part I
1008;1008;MARISHA;MARISHA: How long can I keep her a mouse?;Part I
1009;1009;LAURA;LAURA: Him! Trinket's a boy, all of you, please.;Part I
1010;1010;MARISHA;MARISHA: Up to an hour?;Part I
1011;1011;MATT;MATT: I believe it is, yeah, concentration.;Part I
1012;1012;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I mean, are there like stables?;Part I
1013;1013;LAURA;LAURA: You know, yeah. Can I go downstairs and ask about stables? Maybe he can stay in the stables.;Part I
1014;1014;MATT;MATT: You have to talk to Adra. She's like, “There's no stables in this establishment, but we do have a downstairs storage area your bear can probably stay in.”;Part I
1015;1015;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, he's a bear, he's fine.;Part I
1016;1016;LAURA;LAURA: Trinket, is that okay?;Part I
1017;1017;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: (as Trinket) Yeah, I'm fine.;Part I
1018;1018;LAURA;LAURA: All right, yeah, he's seems to think it's all right. Let's go with the storage room. If there's anything that looks edible, you can eat it. It's fine.;Part I
1019;1019;MATT;MATT: “That's not true.”;Part I
1020;1020;LAURA;LAURA: Just kidding!;Part I
1021;1021;MATT;MATT: “I'll charge you later.”;Part I
1022;1022;MATT;MATT: You bring Trinket back down. Do you release your polymorph?;Part I
1023;1023;MATT;MATT: Trinket becomes a bear again. I'd say the room's probably a good 40 feet by 30 feet.;Part I
1024;1024;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, so he's fine.;Part I
1025;1025;MATT;MATT: Half of it's filled with barrels and crates, and storage of dried foods. Trinket comes in and (sniffing) and starts rummaging into one of the half open sacks of dried meat. That's going to be put on your bill.;Part I
1026;1026;LAURA;LAURA: Shit.;Part I
1027;1027;MATT;MATT: You head back to your rooms for the evening to rest.;Part I
1028;1028;MARISHA;MARISHA: Take a nap.;Part I
1029;1029;MATT;MATT: Anything you guys want to do in preparation for the next day?;Part I
1030;1030;SAM;SAM: No, let's get it on.;Part I
1031;1031;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, we should give our comment cards to Balgus.;Part I
1032;1032;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I think we should all turn in our comment cards.;Part I
1033;1033;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, our comments cards, that's right.;Part I
1034;1034;MATT;MATT: You turn in your comment cards for Balan.;Part I
1035;1035;MARISHA;MARISHA: Balan.;Part I
1036;1036;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I can't stress how important this is.;Part I
1037;1037;LIAM;LIAM: Maybe we should– go ahead, I'm sorry.;Part I
1038;1038;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: No, no, really, no it's fine, speak over me, I don't care.;Part I
1039;1039;MARISHA;MARISHA: Here, take him the extras.;Part I
1040;1040;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We're going to give him a few extras so he can have more comments.;Part I
1041;1041;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yes.;Part I
1042;1042;SAM;SAM: You guys are so kind with these comment cards.;Part I
1043;1043;LIAM;LIAM: Perhaps we should all go to bed, and the humans back in North Hollywood should take a pee break. At some point.;Part I
1044;1044;SAM;SAM: The humans?;Part I
1045;1045;LIAM;LIAM: You. You, and you and you and you and me.;Part I
1046;1046;MATT;MATT: Yes, indeed. Do you want to take a quick restroom break for the folks here?;Part I
1047;1047;SAM;SAM: You okay?;Part I
1048;1048;MATT;MATT: Zac?;Part I
1049;1049;ZAC;ZAC: What's that?;Part I
1050;1050;MATT;MATT: Folks here might want to use the restroom real fast.;Part I
1051;1051;ZAC;ZAC: You want me to play the intro videos again?;Part I
1052;1052;MATT;MATT: You know what, go ahead and play some of the intro videos and we'll come back here in a minute to continue the game, while everyone rests, and empties their bladders. We'll be right back guys. Hang tight.;Part I
1053;1053;SAM;SAM: Commercial break.;Part I
1054;1054;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Right, listen up! If you have ale, then you have a friend in Grog Strongjaw! A goliath of towering height and size, this barbarian has an appetite for the two great loves in his life: combat, women, and ale!;Break
1055;1055;[record scratch] Wait.;[record scratch] Wait.;Break
1056;1056;TRAVIS (CONT'D);TRAVIS (CONT'D): Easily the brains of the group, Grog is often consulted for his vast knowledge of shapes, colors, and shiny things! Also ale. In his early years, armed with his two-handed greataxe, Grog often enjoyed proving his might amongst the ranks of his family's wandering herd. But after coming upon an unsuspecting elderly gnome in the woods, he objected to the killing of such an innocent life. A creature of impulse, Grog felt only pity for this– well, this terrified little thing. And his disobedience cost him dearly. Beaten bloody, and banished by the herd leader, his Uncle Kevdak, Grog was abandoned and left to die. Exiled from his herd, it was then that the relative of the very gnome he fought to save, saved him. It was the kindness of a gnome cleric named Pike that healed Grog, bringing him back from death's edge. And they have remained close friends ever since. Most nights, Grog can be found challenging entire taverns to wrestling matches! Or accompanying Scanlan to the nearest house where you pay for lady favors. Also ale!;Break
1057;1057;MARISHA;MARISHA: A first impression of Keyleth would leave you with little information on the half-elven druid. You might even think that her social awkwardness due to her sheltered upbringing is kind of sweet. Of course, it would be unwise underestimate her based on first impressions.;Break
1058;1058;[thunder crack];[thunder crack];Break
1059;1059;MARISHA (Cont'd);MARISHA (Cont'd): Under that un-intimidating petite frame is a vicious beast waiting to be unleashed, whose natural powers have made even the fiercest of champions pee their pants, literally! Born to the Air Tribe of the Ashari people, Keyleth was raised with a deep love of nature and the elemental magics. It is her people's inherent duty to protect the delicate areas in Tal'Dorei where the four elemental planes begin to bleed with this realm. Since she was a little girl, she had quite a knack for air manipulation and beast shaping abilities. Well, if you consider kittens and flying squirrels to be little beasts...which, I do. Anyways, it wasn't long before the headmaster of the tribe, her father, Korrin, realized her true prodigious abilities and she was inveterated to succeed him as the next headmaster. Just like that, her jovial childhood was stripped and replaced with endless spell memorization, teachings from ancient traditions, and exceedingly high expectations. Every druid leader-to-be must embark on a journey to seek out the sister tribes in order to introduce and establish respect amongst the fellow headmasters. They call this the Aramente, or Noble Odyssey. When her father felt she was ready, he set her on the path to truly discovering herself, not knowing when, or if, she will ever return. As she hiked down the mountain towards Stilben, she meditated on the task ahead. Part of the Aramente is proving yourself a strong warrior, a valiant protector, and a wise and compassionate leader. With this knowledge, one thought plays in repeat in her mind: Is she even worthy?;Break
1060;1060;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Percy was the third child of seven children, born to a noble family who lived far to the north in the ancient castle of Whitestone. With so many siblings to share the burdens of lordship, Percy turned his attention to the sciences, engineering, and naturalism. One day, a mysterious couple, named Lord and Lady Briarwood, came to court. During a feast held in their honor, the Briarwoods violently took control of the castle, killing or imprisoning everyone who would stand in their way. Percy awoke chained in the dungeon, only to be freed by his younger sister. Together they fled, chased by the Briarwoods' men. As they ran, Percy's sister took several arrows to the chest and fell. Percy kept running, eventually jumping into a freezing river and floating unconscious to freedom. He did not remember waking up on a fishing boat. He barely remembered the next two years, as he slowly made his way as far south as possible. Then one night, Percy had a dream: a roaring cloud of smoke offered him vengeance against those who destroyed his family. When he awoke, Percy began to design his first gun.;Break
1061;1061;SAM;SAM: Oh, you haven't heard of Scanlan Shorthalt? Well, gird your loins, ladies, because he has his eye on you. A talented musician, master of disguise, and dashingly handsome in his own mind, Scanlan sings songs almost as much as he sings his own praises. Born a poor gnome, Scanlan used his endless charm and soaring tenor voice to croon for coin and support his single mother. One day, he was discovered by a half-orc promoter, and joined Dr. Dranzel's Spectacular Traveling Troupe where he learned the ways of the world, and honed his skills as a bard extraordinaire. A loner much of his life, Scanlan has never quite come to terms with the violent death of his mother at the hands of a goblin invasion. While his years on the road provided many, shall we say, educational experiences with the opposite sex, deep down Scanlan yearns for the one thing he's never known: the true love of a fellow gnome. Still, Scanlan considers himself a lover first, performer second, and fighter distant third. On the battlefield, he'll support his allies, but rarely draws blood, unless it's to protect fellow gnome, Pike. Count on Scanlan for a hearty laugh, a rollicking song, and a twinkle in his eye that melts hearts and makes the females swoon.;Break
1062;1062;ORION;ORION: Greetings and salutations, I am Tiberius Stormwind. I hail from a town called Tyriex, located in the heart of Draconia. Born from a politically respected family, at the age of 15, I succeeded in passing the Sorcerer's Rite, showing prodigy-like control of my magic. The judges and the Draconian high council were amazed at how powerful my spells were for how long I had been training. At 20 years old, I was the youngest appointed member of the magic guild in Draconian history. For the next few years, I almost went mad from the malaise of being a guild member, as it's rather boring. However, one day I happened upon a chamber, unused for quite some time. In the room were stacks of books and maps of the surrounding cities and areas around the known world. For months, I would frequent the chamber, and learned of artifacts from legend. After a long period of research, I made a list of artifacts that caught my eye. I brought these findings to the high council and was told that all of the information in the chamber I had stumbled upon was either believed to be fiction, or unsolvable mysteries, and hence were lost forever. I found those answers to be unacceptable. A year later, I devised a ruse and managed to convince the city council to lend support in me leaving Draconia on a mission of peace and diplomacy for the surrounding kingdoms. Going from town to town and making friends and allies in and for the name of Draconia. Being a red dragonborn, I had quite the task on my hands in that respect, but it was exactly what I needed so I could explore the world and find these artifacts, as I felt the truth was out there. Some may describe me as buffoonish, but I say poppycock to all that. I am much sharper than most give me credit for. I just don't pay attention to things sometimes. I've also been known to be rather cunning, loyal, happy-go-lucky, and well, dangerous. I can't help but show my true scales every now and then. But overall, I think I'm quite friendly for a dragonborn.;Break
1063;1063;LIAM;LIAM: Never entirely welcome in the company of elves or men, Vax'ildan learned at a young age to skip past formality, preferring instead to invite himself in your door. Along with twin sister, Vex'ahlia, Vax was born by a chance encounter between elven royalty and human peasantry. Raised by their mother in their early years, the twins were eventually sent off to their father in the elven capital of Syngorn. But their cool reception among the elves there never warmed, and their time in the capital didn't last. The siblings stole away one autumn night and set out on the open road. After a few years of wandering, they eventually decided to return to their mother, and journeyed back to the lands of their youth. But instead of finding their childhood home, they returned to a pile of rubble. Their mother was gone, their home burned to ash. Pressing the townspeople for answers, they learned of the day the dragon came. With their ties all severed, Vax'ildan and his sister set out to find their fortune together in Tal'Dorei. An outsider since birth, Vax quickly learned to solve life's challenges in his own particular way, often by sidestepping them entirely. And when his knack for circumventing adversity isn't enough, the way of blades the elves schooled him in more than makes up the difference.;Break
1064;1064;LAURA;LAURA: Like so many half-elves, Vex'ahlia has spent most of her life suffering the cool reception of a people who don't fully accept her. Born of a human mother, and an elven father who only later in life took an interest in their existence, Vex'ahlia and her twin brother, Vax'ildan, quickly realized the only people they could truly rely on in this world were each other. It was at the age of ten when the two were taken from their mother, and brought to live in Syngorn, the isolated elven city for which their father was an ambassador. He quietly took them in, but always kept an icy distance, and after too many years of disdainful looks, the pair decided to leave his indifference behind, and set out on their own. Vax took to the cities, stealing small trinkets and learning the ways of the thief, while Vex kept to the woods. She preferred the isolation. Always the keen observer, she learned to hunt and to track, to spy and to shoot. Through a series of fateful events, earned herself a companion in the form of a bear– her own stolen Trinket – to fight alongside her and protect her fiercely. Also, he is adorable, and gives expert massages.;Break
1065;1065;MATT;MATT: Hello, everyone. Welcome back. We've had our pee breaks. We've had our refills of our drinks. We've got Fireball, so I think we're good for the next venture. Anyway, the party has taken their rest for the evening. Once again, this is one of those weird experiences where you wake up, not because of the sun rising, because you can't see it in the dwarven city of Kraghammer, but eventually you all come to consciousness naturally. What is your plan of action?;Part II
1066;1066;SAM;SAM: Oh, Jesus, we should have all talked about this while we were all peeing.;Part II
1067;1067;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We're going to beat up everybody, right?;Part II
1068;1068;SAM;SAM: Are we going to the manor?;Part II
1069;1069;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I say we have brunch, and we go to the manor–;Part II
1070;1070;LAURA and TRAVIS;LAURA and TRAVIS: Brunch?;Part II
1071;1071;SAM;SAM: Eggs benedict.;Part II
1072;1072;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I want dwarven brunch.;Part II
1073;1073;LIAM;LIAM: I want a traditional dwarven breakfast.;Part II
1074;1074;MARISHA;MARISHA: Dwarven eggs are very good.;Part II
1075;1075;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: They're small.;Part II
1076;1076;MATT;MATT: Okay, so Tiberius fills you all in about his experience, trying to get into the House Thunderbrand.;Part II
1077;1077;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: How you almost got killed?;Part II
1078;1078;ORION;ORION: I didn't, certainly not. I just couldn't get in the door. Rather rude!;Part II
1079;1079;MARISHA;MARISHA: Why did you think that after the magic hand failed that the big thunder ice wave would work?;Part II
1080;1080;ORION;ORION: What I thought is that I could cover the rune with ice and merely step over it. I didn't think it would dissolve my ice.;Part II
1081;1081;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Did you sleep?;Part II
1082;1082;ORION;ORION: Yes.;Part II
1083;1083;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh. I had to make sure, you know.;Part II
1084;1084;ORION;ORION: A good sorcerer always all his tricks before turning around, which is what I did. I think we should go back there because I feel that it's significant that I couldn't get in so easily.;Part II
1085;1085;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We will go back there. I don't think it's the next order of business but I think that we're not leaving the city without dealing with that.;Part II
1086;1086;LAURA;LAURA: Definitely.;Part II
1087;1087;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Do we need to do something with the comment cards?;Part II
1088;1088;LAURA;LAURA: Oh.;Part II
1089;1089;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Did you not fill out your comment card?;Part II
1090;1090;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: No, I did! I know, like, three letters, so like A, F, and A.;Part II
1091;1091;MARISHA;MARISHA: That's okay.;Part II
1092;1092;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: That sounds very positive.;Part II
1093;1093;MARISHA;MARISHA: It's the thought that counts, Grog. It's the thought that counts.;Part II
1094;1094;LAURA;LAURA: Did you put a smiley face next to the A-F-A?;Part II
1095;1095;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I covered my hand in ink.;Part II
1096;1096;LAURA;LAURA: That works.;Part II
1097;1097;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Very good. I think that went well.;Part II
1098;1098;SAM;SAM: Shall we try to make our way to the manor, then?;Part II
1099;1099;LAURA;LAURA: The Greyspine Manor, with our cask of fancy ale/wine.;Part II
1100;1100;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Does the light ever change being underground?;Part II
1101;1101;MATT;MATT: No, it is a perpetual low red glow from all the stones that are embedded around the streets.;Part II
1102;1102;LAURA;LAURA: I feel really sleepy and also very awake at the same time.;Part II
1103;1103;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yeah, I know.;Part II
1104;1104;MATT;MATT: Oh, dwarves.;Part II
1105;1105;LAURA;LAURA: So what do you think?;Part II
1106;1106;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Now I'm curious if there's dwarven coffee.;Part II
1107;1107;MATT;MATT: You guys make your way after your brunch, your delicious dwarven brunch–;Part II
1108;1108;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Thank you!;Part II
1109;1109;MATT;MATT: – which is very alcoholic.;Part II
1110;1110;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yes!;Part II
1111;1111;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: It's like being in New Orleans for the weekend, every meal is going to come with something alcoholic.;Part II
1112;1112;LAURA;LAURA: You're turning yourself into a dwarf?;Part II
1113;1113;SAM;SAM: Did you catch that? He just turned himself into a dwarf.;Part II
1114;1114;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: You did?;Part II
1115;1115;MATT;MATT: Tiberius went (whoosh) into a dwarven form.;Part II
1116;1116;LAURA;LAURA: What kind of dwarf? What do you look like?;Part II
1117;1117;SAM;SAM: He's very handsome for a dwarf.;Part II
1118;1118;LAURA;LAURA: Are you a girl dwarf?;Part II
1119;1119;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yes! You should be a lady dwarf.;Part II
1120;1120;SAM;SAM: Oh yeah, what kind of dwarf? A lady dwarf?;Part II
1121;1121;ORION;ORION: I would not do that again.;Part II
1122;1122;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh, you did do that, you did take it as a troll.;Part II
1123;1123;ORION;ORION: Almost! She shot off the penis.;Part II
1124;1124;LIAM;LIAM: What is going on?;Part II
1125;1125;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: That's where the troll dick came from.;Part II
1126;1126;ORION;ORION: Don't you remember, Vax? I was almost raped by trolls.;Part II
1127;1127;MATT;MATT: There was a cavern interaction with two male trolls that they had stealthed up behind as a party. I love explaining this to the audience. Tiberius then polymorphed into a female troll to try and Bugs Bunny them, not realizing that dwarves who are underground and–;Part II
1128;1128;LAURA;LAURA: Trolls.;Part II
1129;1129;MATT;MATT: –trolls don't encounter female trolls often enough to have a one track mind. He nearly got himself in a very bad situation. That was remedied by the party attacking and Vex over here shooting off the troll's dick. Which then went in the bag of holding, which is disgusting.;Part II
1130;1130;MARISHA;MARISHA: That's also where the hashtag not all trolls came from.;Part II
1131;1131;MATT;MATT: Yup, hashtag not all trolls came from that game. That is horrible.;Part II
1132;1132;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Oh god. Bring it back.;Part II
1133;1133;MARISHA;MARISHA: Bringing it back.;Part II
1134;1134;MATT;MATT: You guys make your way to the residential district. The same guards are there who were there the previous night that encountered you guys so, as you roll up with an entourage-;Part II
1135;1135;SAM;SAM: How many are there?;Part II
1136;1136;MATT;MATT: Currently, there are four.;Part II
1137;1137;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: We can take them.;Part II
1138;1138;LAURA;LAURA: Hi. I wave at Thompson.;Part II
1139;1139;MATT;MATT: He's actually not there. It's the two others that were with you. He is noticeably absent.;Part II
1140;1140;LAURA;LAURA: Oh. Where's Thompson?;Part II
1141;1141;MATT;MATT: They look at each other and they're like, “He's been given the day off.”;Part II
1142;1142;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, really?;Part II
1143;1143;LIAM;LIAM: As you can see, we brought one of your citizens with us to show us a tour of the city.;Part II
1144;1144;SAM;SAM: That's you.;Part II
1145;1145;MATT;MATT: “Citizen? I haven't see you about. What's your name?”;Part II
1146;1146;ORION;ORION: Oh, my name is Tiberius Kraghammer.;Part II
1147;1147;(laughter);(laughter);Part II
1148;1148;SAM;SAM: Like Johnny New York.;Part II
1149;1149;ORION;ORION: Shoot, we're in Kraghammer, right?;Part II
1150;1150;SAM;SAM: We're in Kraghammer.;Part II
1151;1151;ORION;ORION: Oh, Stronghammer.;Part II
1152;1152;SAM;SAM: Johnny New York.;Part II
1153;1153;MATT;MATT: “What is it, Kraghammer, or what was it?”;Part II
1154;1154;(laughter);(laughter);Part II
1155;1155;ORION;ORION: I meant–I meant Stronghammer. Kraghammer is my father's cousin's side.;Part II
1156;1156;MATT;MATT: “How drunk are you?”;Part II
1157;1157;ORION;ORION: I've been drinking since I've woken.;Part II
1158;1158;MATT;MATT: Make a persuasion check.;Part II
1159;1159;SAM;SAM: See, he is one of you!;Part II
1160;1160;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I had a lot of breakfast.;Part II
1161;1161;ORION;ORION: Oh yay, 19.;Part II
1162;1162;MATT;MATT: 19.;Part II
1163;1163;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Tiberius Kraghammer.;Part II
1164;1164;MATT;MATT: “All right, I haven't seen you around, but obviously it's a bit early to be that fucked up.”;Part II
1165;1165;ORION;ORION: I've been very depressed, you know.;Part II
1166;1166;MATT;MATT: Well, what's your business, if I might ask again? You already seen the statue.;Part II
1167;1167;LAURA;LAURA: Yeah, we saw the statue, but we wanted to get a better look at it. We brought this gift for the Greyspines and we wanted to present it to them.;Part II
1168;1168;MATT;MATT: The two new Carvers step forward and look at it. “Ooh!”;Part II
1169;1169;LAURA;LAURA: It's really nice.;Part II
1170;1170;MATT;MATT: One of them's like, “I'll tell you what. If you let us taste a bit of that, we'll let you go.”;Part II
1171;1171;ORION;ORION: Oh, I mean, I've been drinking a lot of it, sure!;Part II
1172;1172;LAURA;LAURA: A thimble of it because if any of it goes missing– Is it sealed? Can we tell if it's sealed?;Part II
1173;1173;MATT;MATT: You look at it. It does not have any sort of port or exit on it. It is just a solid barrel.;Part II
1174;1174;ORION;ORION: Maybe, we can save some for them.;Part II
1175;1175;LAURA;LAURA:. If we open it, it'll ruin the barrel, right?;Part II
1176;1176;MATT;MATT: “Ah, that's right.”;Part II
1177;1177;LAURA;LAURA: Maybe we can save you a bottle of it when we open it inside. We'll give it to you later.;Part II
1178;1178;MATT;MATT: Make a persuasion check for that. It's a very persuasion based encounter.;Part II
1179;1179;LAURA;LAURA: Should I roll that one that failed me earlier or my little dice?;Part II
1180;1180;MATT;MATT: The little dice! They haven't come out yet!;Part II
1181;1181;LAURA;LAURA: (high-pitched) My little, tiny dice.;Part II
1182;1182;MATT;MATT: Itty bitty dice.;Part II
1183;1183;LAURA;LAURA: Teeny tiny dice. Okay that's better, I rolled a 23.;Part II
1184;1184;MATT;MATT: Okay. They all look at each other. “If you can save enough for all four of us, please do. Bring it back, we'll be looking forward to it.”;Part II
1185;1185;ORION;ORION: Do you have any flasks that we could use to fill them up?;Part II
1186;1186;LAURA;LAURA: We've got some bottles, don't worry.;Part II
1187;1187;MATT;MATT: “We'll be waiting. If you don't show with the drink, we'll go right to our supervisor.” They all nod.;Part II
1188;1188;LAURA;LAURA: Yeah, keep nodding. Here's the thing. I don't know if I can save four bottles worth, but I'll save as much as I can.;Part II
1189;1189;SAM and TALIESIN;SAM and TALIESIN: Just say yes.;Part II
1190;1190;LAURA;LAURA: Hey, I've got it covered.;Part II
1191;1191;LIAM;LIAM: On our father's good name, we will bring you some of this. That is a promise.;Part II
1192;1192;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: It's a good name.;Part II
1193;1193;MATT;MATT: They all look about each other. “Fine. Remember, we're waiting.” They all lick their lips a little. They part and let you guys into the residential district. You make your way to the very back. You can see House Greyspine. Once again, guys, for those who haven't been there before, it's a beautiful arrangement. The iron gate around it with spikes on the top. You can see the entire front yard, it's about a good 80 yard walk to the front of the building itself. It's a quite a distance from the front gate and that entire area is filled with like a stone garden with various small sculptures and interesting knick knacks they collected and put on display like as a small museum as you approach the front of House Greyspine. You get to the front door as a large double oak door about ten feet tall, four feet wide, currently closed. There is no handle on the door.;Part II
1194;1194;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: No handle?;Part II
1195;1195;MATT;MATT: No.;Part II
1196;1196;ORION;ORION: Hold on, wait. Don't knock on anything. Things shock you here.;Part II
1197;1197;SAM;SAM: Let's go knock on the door.;Part II
1198;1198;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I want to double check, see if there's a bell to ring or there seems to be some sort of calling–;Part II
1199;1199;MATT;MATT: Easily enough, you see next to the door there is a small chain that protrudes from the stone wall. It has a small bulbous ball at the end.;Part II
1200;1200;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Ding ding. Ding-a-ding.;Part II
1201;1201;MATT;MATT: You pull it. Not a ding, but a large (clanging). It is a heavier chain than you expected. As you pull on it, you feel a large hammer-like object is slamming into a brass-type material as it echoes and resounds in the building. Definitely announcing your presence.;Part II
1202;1202;MARISHA;MARISHA: Percy, can I try?;Part II
1203;1203;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: If you must, yes.;Part II
1204;1204;MARISHA;MARISHA: Okay!;Part II
1205;1205;MATT;MATT: Boosh! It echoes into the house.;Part II
1206;1206;MARISHA;MARISHA: I just wanted to do that once! I'm sorry.;Part II
1207;1207;SAM;SAM: Should we ding-dong-ditch?;Part II
1208;1208;(laughter);(laughter);Part II
1209;1209;LIAM;LIAM: Scanlan perhaps a little ditty on strings will ease our introduction.;Part II
1210;1210;SAM;SAM: I'll start singing a little jaunty welcoming song. (singing) Hello, hello, we're here to pay you calling. Hello, hello I don't know what rhymes with calling.;Part II
1211;1211;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: “Calling,” at the very least. I thought you would go right there.;Part II
1212;1212;SAM;SAM: Yes, it's true.;Part II
1213;1213;MATT;MATT: All right, are you going to play the music for the sake of playing music?;Part II
1214;1214;SAM;SAM: Yes, for now.;Part II
1215;1215;MATT;MATT: All right. About ten seconds pass before the door– you hear a large (thudding) and one of the doors opens up. You see a dwarf, with long gray hair that's slicked back and pulled into a ponytail. A very small trimmed beard, very proper, steps out in long black robes and goes, “Can I help you?”;Part II
1216;1216;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Percy?;Part II
1217;1217;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Yes, Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.;Part II
1218;1218;ORION;ORION: You can call him Percy.;Part II
1219;1219;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: You can simply call me Percy, thank you. We're here to discuss some business with Lord Greyspine and we have, of course, brought gifts and our charming company.;Part II
1220;1220;LIAM;LIAM: As well as our dwarven compatriot to introduce us.;Part II
1221;1221;ORION;ORION: Yes, who? I am quite drunk right now.;Part II
1222;1222;MATT;MATT: He gives you an awkward look. It's like a look of trying to place your face. “Which lord are you looking for?”;Part II
1223;1223;LAURA;LAURA: Actually Nostoc.;Part II
1224;1224;ORION;ORION: Is he the nice one? I would like the nice one.;Part II
1225;1225;MATT;MATT: “Nostoc, I'm afraid, is currently working at the quarry, if he's who you're looking for.”;Part II
1226;1226;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, of course he is.;Part II
1227;1227;SAM;SAM: If Gradon is here, is that his name? Gradon?;Part II
1228;1228;MATT;MATT: He gives you this look. “Gradem is not taking visitors.”;Part II
1229;1229;LAURA;LAURA: Of course not.;Part II
1230;1230;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: That's a shame, we brought this half-barrel of ale right here and some–;Part II
1231;1231;SAM;SAM: And some very, very attractive mining contracts, but if there's no one here to talk about them–;Part II
1232;1232;MATT;MATT: He gives you this look. “If you're talking mining contracts you want to head to the quarry and talk to, Lord–” Looking him up again in my notes. “You want to talk to Nostoc Greyspine. He's the one who runs the quarry. As far as the Ironkeeper himself– I mean no offense, but only official political business.”;Part II
1233;1233;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Well, this is definitely official political business. I will also say, could you direct us to the quarry? We are new in town.;Part II
1234;1234;MATT;MATT: “Obviously. Have you not shown them where the quarry is, friend?”;Part II
1235;1235;ORION;ORION: I have no idea what's going even going on.;Part II
1236;1236;SAM;SAM: Jesus.;Part II
1237;1237;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: He's been drinking since very early this morning.;Part II
1238;1238;MARISHA;MARISHA: He's on vacation. You'll have to excuse him.;Part II
1239;1239;ORION;ORION: I must say, I am having a wonderful time.;Part II
1240;1240;MARISHA;MARISHA: You know, friends are in town, he's showing us around.;Part II
1241;1241;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: What was your name, again?;Part II
1242;1242;MATT;MATT: The dwarf gives you a subtle look, goes, “My name is Magrim. I am the servant of the Ironkeeper himself.”;Part II
1243;1243;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Magrim, of course you're the servant. You are filled with poise and sophistication, and of course, above all, protocol. I would not wish you to break protocol which is why some simple directions, for those of us who are wishing to do some official business. You'll be right on your way and your house will return to order.;Part II
1244;1244;MATT;MATT: “Right. The Ironkeeper is not open to business outside of pre-approved political understanding.”;Part II
1245;1245;LAURA;LAURA: Of course.;Part II
1246;1246;MATT;MATT: “If you don't have a pre-approved meeting put within our ledger, you won't be seen.”;Part II
1247;1247;LAURA;LAURA: Of course not, but for the mining contracts, however, wouldn't we need to speak to Nostoc? Is there any way– I hear it's very hard to get down into the mines. It's very well-guarded, right? That's why we came to speak to him here.;Part II
1248;1248;MATT;MATT: He leans over and looks at the cask of ale and says, “Down to the mines, you have to go to one of the chain platform posts at the edge of town that will bring you to the base area. Find your way to the mines there. That should be enough to get Nostoc's attention. The rest is up to you.”;Part II
1249;1249;LAURA;LAURA: Lovely. Thank you so much.;Part II
1250;1250;SAM;SAM: One moment, before we adjourn– (whispers) Do we want to try to get into this place, or are we just going to go to the mines?;Part II
1251;1251;LAURA;LAURA: (whispers) Maybe we should talk to Nostoc first.;Part II
1252;1252;SAM;SAM: And ditch this place?;Part II
1253;1253;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Every time we break into someone's house it turns out poorly.;Part II
1254;1254;LAURA;LAURA: We're trying to get to the mines, essentially.;Part II
1255;1255;LIAM;LIAM: I think he's still listening.;Part II
1256;1256;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Good man, good day. We'll be on our way, thank you.;Part II
1257;1257;LAURA;LAURA: Magrim, you've been wonderful. Thank you so much. We plan on keeping some of this ale and bringing it back to the household. Would you like some when we open the cask?;Part II
1258;1258;MATT;MATT: He looks down at the cask, looks up at you and says, “I would not turn down a sip or two.”;Part II
1259;1259;LAURA;LAURA: Lovely. We'll be sure to save you a small bottle.;Part II
1260;1260;SAM;SAM: I'm going to turn invisible.;Part II
1261;1261;MATT;MATT: As he's looking over there, you vanish. All right.;Part II
1262;1262;LAURA;LAURA: You can do that?!;Part II
1263;1263;SAM;SAM: And I'm sneaking into the house.;Part II
1264;1264;LIAM;LIAM: To what end?!;Part II
1265;1265;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: That's awesome! Who cares? Light it up!;Part II
1266;1266;SAM;SAM: I don't know why!;Part II
1267;1267;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: He's gone nuts!;Part II
1268;1268;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We are off the reservation.;Part II
1269;1269;MATT;MATT: “Is that all your business?”;Part II
1270;1270;LAURA;LAURA: I believe it is all of our business.;Part II
1271;1271;MATT;MATT: “Well, good day.” He steps back into the doorway and closes the large oak doors. You are now standing in the foyer of Palace Greyspine. A luxurious foyer, the floor itself is a fine dark velvet red carpet. There are tapestries across the walls and small wooden end tables set at the edges of the hallway, this foyer area that contains sculptures and vases and plants that exist underground specifically. There's a large stairway that leads up into the upper portion of the house and two doors at each side that lead to rooms you no longer can see.;Part II
1272;1272;ORION;ORION: I use the earpiece and whisper: What are you doing, Scanlan?! What are you doing?!;Part II
1273;1273;SAM;SAM: I don't know! Give me 20 minutes!;Part II
1274;1274;LAURA;LAURA: 20 minutes, that's okay! Let's all step away from the house.;Part II
1275;1275;MARISHA;MARISHA: Ask if he needs assistance or divergent–;Part II
1276;1276;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Divergent?;Part II
1277;1277;MARISHA;MARISHA: Divergent.;Part II
1278;1278;MATT;MATT: Magrim wipes his hands and walks away going, “(sigh) Fucking foreigners.”;Part II
1279;1279;SAM;SAM: I follow him where he's going.;Part II
1280;1280;MATT;MATT: Okay.;Part II
1281;1281;SAM;SAM: My nervousness, I let out a little bit of a fart as we–;Part II
1282;1282;MATT;MATT: Make a stealth check.;Part II
1283;1283;ORION;ORION: Why are you making it harder on yourself?;Part II
1284;1284;SAM;SAM: 14 plus I'm invisible, plus two. 16.;Part II
1285;1285;MATT;MATT: Because you're invisible, I'll give you advantage on that. Go ahead and roll.;Part II
1286;1286;SAM;SAM: Oh, well. 14. Plus two. 16.;Part II
1287;1287;MATT;MATT: As you scamper by, behind Magrim, following him towards the kitchen area of the abode, Magrim stops and turns, rubs his stomach, goes (groaning) and continues walking forward, seemingly unperturbed by the sound.;Part II
1288;1288;SAM;SAM: I'm snooping around, trying to see if there's any lords or higher ranking individuals in the area.;Part II
1289;1289;MATT;MATT: Okay, I'll say within the time that you have within the house, you wander through quite a few rooms. There's a wonderful music room, which contains a number of dwarven instruments that you've read of and many instruments that you know as well. You actually find another, what do you call it again? A shawm?;Part II
1290;1290;SAM;SAM: Shawm.;Part II
1291;1291;MATT;MATT: A shawm. You find another shawm within, more finely crafted than the one that you have.;Part II
1292;1292;SAM;SAM: Oh fuck.;Part II
1293;1293;MATT;MATT: A gift of lords, if you will.;Part II
1294;1294;SAM;SAM: I'm so tempted, but no.;Part II
1295;1295;LAURA;LAURA: Does he have an earring on? Does he have one of our earrings?;Part II
1296;1296;LIAM;LIAM: We all do.;Part II
1297;1297;MATT;MATT: Not everyone, you only made a few.;Part II
1298;1298;SAM;SAM: Just me and him.;Part II
1299;1299;LAURA;LAURA: Who all has an earring?;Part II
1300;1300;SAM;SAM: He can talk to me, apparently.;Part II
1301;1301;LAURA;LAURA: Tiberius, tell him to look for paperwork of something. For the mines!;Part II
1302;1302;ORION;ORION: Scanlan, look for paperwork of something else, and by the way, all of you should be hearing me right now, you all have the ear–;Part II
1303;1303;LAURA;LAURA: Not everyone. You only made like five or something.;Part II
1304;1304;MATT;MATT: You could only afford five.;Part II
1305;1305;ORION;ORION: That's right. (clears throat) Do all those things, Scanlan.;Part II
1306;1306;SAM;SAM: Great.;Part II
1307;1307;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Who's talking right now?;Part II
1308;1308;MATT;MATT: As you look about the household, you also come across a couple of bed chambers that are locked, pretty hefty lock.;Part II
1309;1309;SAM;SAM: Not going to try.;Part II
1310;1310;MATT;MATT: Okay. You make your way up the stairway, and there's a long hall that leads to, essentially, a throne room that is still partially under construction, mostly finished. It actually was an intentional build onto this house. House Greyspine, when the current Ironkeeper went into office, it seems, began to have this room built. It's nearly finished, but it's an extravagant room with a large stone and dark metal throne, steps lead up to it, and its raised dais-like pedestal in the center of the room. A series of great magically glowing and flickering lanterns across them. There are two dwarves inside that are currently finishing up the stone work. They're doing various sorts of masonry and plastering in areas and carving out and chiselling out pieces of stone, and making them intricately carved in this flavor. Other than that the room is currently empty.;Part II
1311;1311;SAM;SAM: Shit. There's nothing to steal!;Part II
1312;1312;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Drop a deuce in the bedroom!;Part II
1313;1313;MATT;MATT: Hashtag “gnomishdeuce.”;Part II
1314;1314;ORION;ORION: Damn it, Scanlan! Just get out of there! What are you doing?;Part II
1315;1315;LAURA;LAURA: You totally should!;Part II
1316;1316;TRAVIS and LAURA;TRAVIS and LAURA: An invisible poo!;Part II
1317;1317;SAM;SAM: I might as well try one of the doors that's locked, and see if I can pick it, but I'm not good at that, so I'll try.;Part II
1318;1318;MATT;MATT: Okay. Do you have on your person any sort of thieves' tools?;Part II
1319;1319;SAM;SAM: I have a forgery kit, a poisoner's kit–;Part II
1320;1320;MARISHA;MARISHA: Forge some thieves' tools real quick.;Part II
1321;1321;SAM;SAM: Climbing gear? And a whip.;Part II
1322;1322;LIAM;LIAM: Matt, I have one of the earrings, and I say: Scanlan, what exactly is the purpose for this little escapade, and will it be ending shortly?;Part II
1323;1323;SAM;SAM: Can I reply?;Part II
1324;1324;MATT;MATT: You can, through the message-based ear enchantment.;Part II
1325;1325;SAM;SAM: Just trust me that I have no idea what I'm doing.;Part II
1326;1326;MATT;MATT: Do you wish to pick one of the doors?;Part II
1327;1327;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Do it.;Part II
1328;1328;SAM;SAM: Yeah, I'm going to try one!;Part II
1329;1329;MATT;MATT: Okay, you have disadvantage on this.;Part II
1330;1330;SAM;SAM: Of course I do.;Part II
1331;1331;MATT;MATT: So roll twice, and we'll consider this a straight dexterity check.;Part II
1332;1332;SAM;SAM: 11, plus zero?;Part II
1333;1333;MATT;MATT: You futz with the door for a good minute, trying to bend a piece of wire you had, thinking to forge some tumblers, and eventually get to a point where you hear, (tink). And it broke.;Part II
1334;1334;SAM;SAM: I can't do two spells at once, so I will give it up and I'll make my way to the door.;Part II
1335;1335;MATT;MATT: Okay. The door is currently closed.;Part II
1336;1336;SAM;SAM: I become un-invisible and I cast Dimension Door.;Part II
1337;1337;MATT;MATT: All right. You blink through this small, purplish arcane doorway. It brings you directly outside. You guys are waiting, Scanlan just pops into view.;Part II
1338;1338;SAM;SAM: It was crazy in there! People were farting everywhere! It was not me. They're building a throne room, there were some locked doors. Man, I wish you could have been there! It was exciting, but ultimately pointless. Let's go down to the mines!;Part II
1339;1339;LIAM;LIAM: I would like to stress again that none of these dwarves are our enemies, at all. We just want to go have some words with Greyspine.;Part II
1340;1340;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: That we do not have our healer, at present.;Part II
1341;1341;LIAM;LIAM: Well, we do, but she's very distracted, and is not feeling herself.;Part II
1342;1342;SAM;SAM: She wanted to stay at the inn this morning.;Part II
1343;1343;LIAM;LIAM: She's feeling awfully BAFTA today, so.;Part II
1344;1344;SAM;SAM: Let's make our way to the mines, shall we?;Part II
1345;1345;ORION;ORION: Metal poisoning, yes.;Part II
1346;1346;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: To the mines, then, yeah.;Part II
1347;1347;LIAM;LIAM: Let's go get this drunk dwarf!;Part II
1348;1348;MATT;MATT: Yes, the bard was doing a lockpick with no lockpicks. He was fashioning it from wire. Exciting but pointless! You make your way to the edge of the center ring. You find that there are long spiral staircases that move to the bottom, where there are elevators that bring you to the bottom floor. The elevators are chain based, like a ratchet-type system with two Carvers there, of course. You approach one, eventually you talk with them, they lead you down there, but once again they give you a look of, “Watch your back!”;Part II
1349;1349;LAURA;LAURA: We point at the ale and give him a thumbs up!;Part II
1350;1350;MATT;"MATT: They nod, and let you pass. As you continue downward into the lower area, you can see the red stone that lets a lot of the atmospheric glow of Kraghammer is used less and less and a lot more central torches are now in place; sconces. The stone itself is either rarer the further down you go or has less of an illuminating power the deeper into the earth. You eventually reach into the center part of town. You now see from where you're standing a number of large structures in the very center of the bottom part of the city of Kraghammer. You can see– There is a giant domed temple that is made of gold and bronze in the center. It looks almost like a gargantuan gazebo that has doorways on each side that is currently closed off. No guards at it, though. You do see a number of other buildings. There is a large, heavy foundry far off to the left of you that has a little bit of smoke that's coming off of it, but most of it looks to be filtered into a giant, metallic funnel that is then placed into the rock. Almost like all the smoke based exhaust is being funneled outside of the mountain. That is the closest; that's the foundry. Then to the right of you, you wander a bit and you can begin to see that part of the mountainside to the far right has that look of a strip mine, or like a large portion of the minerals has been pulled away and is currently being mined further. That looks like probably one of the better places to look in looking for the Greyspine Quarry. You eventually make your way to the outside of the quarry. You now look down into three large pits that descend deeply into the side of the mountain. This mine has been going for quite some time and a large chunk of this looks like it may be being prepped; almost like the mine is what's growing Kraghammer. The more they mine into the mountain, the more they fill the mined area with further city construction. It's this self perpetuating cycle of expanding the city downward. Currently in the quarry, there are a number of large stone dwarven buildings in the edge of it, one of which is the largest of them all, looks like it's made more of a black and red, iron aesthetic; some of it's been oxidized a little bit and has that rough and tumble, iron feel. That one has the most guards around the base of it. The Carvers are gathered entirely around it. Looking down into the center of the quarry, towards the bottom there are a number of tunnels that lead into the hillside of Cliffkeep Mountains proper, surrounding Kraghammer.";Part II
1351;1351;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Let's go where the guards are.;Part II
1352;1352;LAURA;LAURA: Let's walk towards the guards.;Part II
1353;1353;LIAM;LIAM: Let's just do this directly, I think.;Part II
1354;1354;SAM;SAM: Just swords out.;Part II
1355;1355;MARISHA;MARISHA: Wait. Before we go up, I take the cask of ale and I grow some pretty flowers on it, and I make a nice pretty bow and I shine it up a little.;Part II
1356;1356;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: You're making a fruit basket?;Part II
1357;1357;MARISHA;MARISHA: No, I'm just– it looks attractive now.;Part II
1358;1358;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: It looks like a fruit basket.;Part II
1359;1359;MARISHA;MARISHA: It does not look like a fruit basket. It's not that ostentatious.;Part II
1360;1360;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: It's the “Ale of the Month” Club.;Part II
1361;1361;LIAM;LIAM: In her defense, they probably don't see flowers too often. It's a nice touch.;Part II
1362;1362;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: That is very fair.;Part II
1363;1363;ORION;ORION: I'm going to take this opportunity to cast Stoneskin on myself.;Part II
1364;1364;MATT;MATT: Okay. Stoneskin is placed on you.;Part II
1365;1365;SAM;SAM: Are you a dwarf still?;Part II
1366;1366;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Are you a dwarf made of stone?;Part II
1367;1367;MATT;MATT: You have not turned Alter Self off. You are still a dwarf.;Part II
1368;1368;ORION;ORION: Yeah, that's fine.;Part II
1369;1369;MATT;MATT: Oh, Stoneskin is a concentration spell, so yes, that would eliminate the Alter Self spell. Okay, so you revert back to your dragon form, robed self, but Stoneskin is in effect. You using your, what's it called again?;Part II
1370;1370;MARISHA;MARISHA: Druidcraft.;Part II
1371;1371;MATT;MATT: Druidcraft! Thank you. The Prestidigitation for hippies. Portions of the wood begin to sprout from the outside of this dark wood barrel and form these entangled ivy vines that eventually embrace the entirety of this cask with little buds of dark, ruddy flowers. Something that would definitely appeal to a dwarven aesthetic.;Part II
1372;1372;MARISHA;MARISHA: That's hot.;Part II
1373;1373;MATT;MATT: You approach the guards, of which there are eight currently at the front.;Part II
1374;1374;LAURA;LAURA: Can I use my perception to see which one of them looks maybe the most interested or weakest?;Part II
1375;1375;MATT;MATT: Would be more of an insight.;Part II
1376;1376;LAURA;LAURA: Insight! Which one of them looks most interested in our party.;Part II
1377;1377;MATT;MATT: Yeah.;Part II
1378;1378;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, good. I thought that was a one, but it's not. It was a 13.;Part II
1379;1379;MATT;MATT: 13? Okay. Strangely enough, they are fairly distracted and after a rather long, uneventful morning, most of them are used to being in armor and waiting for business to go down. There are a few along the edges that look a little more alert, and one of them is looking occasionally down into the quarry. Just keeping an eye on the established area.;Part II
1380;1380;LAURA;LAURA: Which one looks like the newest?;Part II
1381;1381;MATT;MATT: The newest of the bunch would be the one that's on the far left that is looking down into the quarry as well. He has a shaved head, has a small brownish beard that looks like he's starting to grow out into a nice, long tuft. Either it got shaved in some, I don't know, terrible college dwarf accident. You know part of his entry into some fraternity.;Part II
1382;1382;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Dwarf Sigma Sigma.;Part II
1383;1383;MATT;MATT: It's a fairly thick tuft of unkempt brown beard that goes about that far out. It's starting to be pulled in like tiny little scruffy braids. It's not quite there and he probably gets a lot of shit for it from the other dwarves. He seems to generally be looking at you guys.;Part II
1384;1384;LIAM;LIAM: Okay, work your magic.;Part II
1385;1385;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, do your thing– fuck these dwarves up.;Part II
1386;1386;SAM;SAM: What are we trying to do?;Part II
1387;1387;LAURA;LAURA: We brought this gift. Hello! We address all of them, maybe, right now, yes?;Part II
1388;1388;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: She is better at this. I'm going to let her do this.;Part II
1389;1389;LAURA and SAM;LAURA and SAM: Hello, hi!;Part II
1390;1390;ORION;ORION: Greetings and salutations!;Part II
1391;1391;MATT;MATT: The other guards reach back and grab their weapons. One of them looking to you.;Part II
1392;1392;ORION;ORION: Oh, you don't need that.;Part II
1393;1393;LAURA;LAURA: I look over at the shaved-head one and I hold his gaze for a little bit.;Part II
1394;1394;LIAM;LIAM: I give Vex a little push forward.;Part II
1395;1395;LAURA;LAURA: Pardon me. Not yet!;Part II
1396;1396;MATT;MATT: “All right, what's your business?”;Part II
1397;1397;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, yes, well– we are here to speak with Nostoc. We brought a gift for him that's quite remarkable, actually.;Part II
1398;1398;MATT;MATT: They curl up around the apparent barrel that Grog's holding. They look wary of Grog, but once they make note of the barrel they all, “Ooh!”;Part II
1399;1399;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Right? It's the shit.;Part II
1400;1400;MATT;MATT: “I've heard of that, but I've not seen anyone actually drink it. There were long standing rumors that this even existed.”;Part II
1401;1401;LAURA;LAURA: It exists.;Part II
1402;1402;SAM;SAM: And it's for Nostoc.;Part II
1403;1403;MATT;MATT: “This is a Balgus original?”;Part II
1404;1404;LAURA;LAURA: Yes.;Part II
1405;1405;MATT “Signed by himself I see on the burned, emblazoned wood. I'll go talk to him!” He heads inside of the building, the doors close behind him. The other guards encroach, keeping a very keen eye, each one having a bead on the rest of your group. About two minutes pass before he comes back, opens the door and the dwarf goes, “Nostoc will see you briefly, but you best bring the gift. I think that's what's holding his interest.”;MATT “Signed by himself I see on the burned, emblazoned wood. I'll go talk to him!” He heads inside of the building, the doors close behind him. The other guards encroach, keeping a very keen eye, each one having a bead on the rest of your group. About two minutes pass before he comes back, opens the door and the dwarf goes, “Nostoc will see you briefly, but you best bring the gift. I think that's what's holding his interest.”;Part II
1406;1406;ORION;ORION: Wonderful!;Part II
1407;1407;MATT;MATT: “Inside, please.” Him and one other guard flank you guys as you enter, making sure that you are not left without that appearance. You are led into the center of this portion of the mine's main structure, a series of long hallways. There's this general smell of soot and ash and broken stone dust in the air. A hint of brimstone-ish smell. It's not very pleasant, it's very well worn and pungent for those of you who spend most of their time on the surface. As you enter, there is a general dust in the air, a little light seems to peek through from the torches that are placed up along the wall. You can see this general haze amongst the interior here. It's definitely a work environment at the base of an underground dwarven establishment used to mine. You are led further down the hallway. It curves to the left and you're brought into a large dwarven study. There are books on the walls, a series of ledgers and paper stacks on a large desk and at the center there sits a dwarf with fiery red hair cut very short, almost like a buzz-cut on the top, with a long beard that is not braided, but kept very smooth and very– not curly, not bunched, it's a very straight beard. He's very clean cut, he already has this intimidating dark glare. As you walk into the room he goes, “Okay, you brought me a drink. You have my attention. What brings you to the mines?”;Part II
1408;1408;SAM;SAM: We should have talked this through before.;Part II
1409;1409;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Well, several things actually. Several things bring us to the mine. My name, of course, is Percival Fredrickstein von Musel Klossowski de Rolo III.;Part II
1410;1410;ALL;ALL: You can call him Percy!;Part II
1411;1411;MATT;MATT: He raises his finger and goes, “You have not paid for your pleasantries yet.”;Part II
1412;1412;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, of course. Grog, if you would.;Part II
1413;1413;LIAM;LIAM: Tap that motherfucker!;Part II
1414;1414;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I am assuming he had a goblet on the table.;Part II
1415;1415;MATT;MATT: As you pull it up he pulls under his desk and pulls up a goblet. As you fill it, “Top it off! Thank you! Now put on the side of the desk!”;Part II
1416;1416;SAM;SAM: Wait! Mister Greyspine. Oh, okay, all right.;Part II
1417;1417;MATT;MATT: Puts it down. (satisfied sigh);Part II
1418;1418;LAURA;LAURA: Is it as amazing as we've heard?;Part II
1419;1419;MATT;MATT: “It's pretty fucking good.” He takes another long drag, while making sure you all watch him do this. This goes on probably a little longer, the pageantry of him drinking this in front of you is definitely a power play, and he's establishing some sort of unspoken dominance in the room. Eventually he finishes his tankard, sets it down under the desk again. “Right, so where were we?”;Part II
1420;1420;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We were here to call upon your expertise. We imagine that we are not the first strangers to Kraghammer to come through–;Part II
1421;1421;LAURA;LAURA: – in the last few weeks.;Part II
1422;1422;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: In the last few weeks. We believe one of our compatriots had some dealings with you, perhaps not as pleasant as the dealings we are hoping to have.;Part II
1423;1423;SAM;SAM: A lady, in fact.;Part II
1424;1424;LAURA;LAURA: A halfling.;Part II
1425;1425;MATT;MATT: At which point, as you say that, he gets this grin to his face and goes, “Aye, I know of the one you speak.”;Part II
1426;1426;LAURA;LAURA: Yes.;Part II
1427;1427;MATT;MATT: “She is a strong-headed one, that one.”;Part II
1428;1428;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Yes.;Part II
1429;1429;MATT;MATT: “She stepped on a few toes around this place.”;Part II
1430;1430;ORION;ORION: Oh, was she clumsy?;Part II
1431;1431;MATT;MATT: “One could say that, aye. You say you are compatriots of hers?”;Part II
1432;1432;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We're here to mend any broken bridges, so to speak.;Part II
1433;1433;MARISHA;MARISHA: Or broken toes, if you will.;Part II
1434;1434;MATT;MATT: “She certainly left a mess in her wake. There's this strange vision quest she kept talking about. It brought her into atmospheres– portions of this city, portions of my business that she has no right trespassing on. She went against Carver rules, she broke away from partial arrest and she went screaming down into the caverns of our mines without my permission, blade drawn on some crazed suicide mission.”;Part II
1435;1435;LAURA;LAURA: You know what? We'll go after her. We'll bring her out. We'll get her out of your mines.;Part II
1436;1436;MATT;MATT: “Great. I'd like that actually.”;Part II
1437;1437;LAURA;LAURA: Good!;Part II
1438;1438;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We'd be happy to clear out anything unpleasant that we happen to find in there in the meantime.“;Part II
1439;1439;ORION;ORION: How did she look?;Part II
1440;1440;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: What?;Part II
1441;1441;MATT;"MATT: ""She looked small and angry. She seemed to have some weight to her. She was a strong lass.”";Part II
1442;1442;ORION;ORION: So not a looker is what you are saying.;Part II
1443;1443;MATT;MATT: He gives you this strange look and goes, “I will not discuss the physical aesthetics of a halfling.”;Part II
1444;1444;SAM;SAM: The dwarf is a feminist.;Part II
1445;1445;LAURA;LAURA: How much would this task be worth to you? Obviously we are doing you quite a favor and we brought you quite a gift!;Part II
1446;1446;SAM;SAM: This cost us a thousand gold.;Part II
1447;1447;MATT;MATT: “Obviously this lass means a lot to you, doesn't she?”;Part II
1448;1448;LAURA;LAURA: No, but I know she is probably wreaking havoc on your mines.;Part II
1449;1449;LIAM;LIAM: We've come to correct the wrongs that she's done and come to bring her home.;Part II
1450;1450;MARISHA;MARISHA: It also sounds like there are some other terrible things wreaking havoc on your mines.;Part II
1451;1451;MATT;MATT: “There is nothing going on, we're fine. We have everything under control, we don't need your help for that. If you want to find your friend, go find her! If she is still alive. If not, take her corpse back and leave.”;Part II
1452;1452;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: It's not help, sir. We are simply respecting you as a businessman. As a businessman I'm sure that you would disagree with unceremonious charity whether it would be to give it or receive it. We are making sure that our dealings with you are fair and balanced.;Part II
1453;1453;MATT;MATT: “I appreciate your offering. You have bought your time. Now, if you are here to go find your;Part II
1454;1454;friend, I'll let you pass. You may pass into the mine, but if at any moment you cross over to any sort of thieving bullshite–” Looks over at you. “I recommend–”;friend, I'll let you pass. You may pass into the mine, but if at any moment you cross over to any sort of thieving bullshite–” Looks over at you. “I recommend–”;Part II
1455;1455;(laughter);(laughter);Part II
1456;1456;“I recommend– that you fall down the same path your friend likely did and get killed real quick. I don't take kindly to those who cross on my business.”;“I recommend– that you fall down the same path your friend likely did and get killed real quick. I don't take kindly to those who cross on my business.”;Part II
1457;1457;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I doubt that we could find anything of more value that what we have already brought you.;Part II
1458;1458;LIAM;LIAM: We are here to right wrongs and I promise you, our business is finding her and returning home.“;Part II
1459;1459;MATT;"MATT: ""Then go.”";Part II
1460;1460;LAURA;LAURA: Is that our business?;Part II
1461;1461;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, we are here to right wrongs and right lefts.;Part II
1462;1462;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: And write comment cards.;Part II
1463;1463;MARISHA;MARISHA: Wait, before we dive into this mountain– we know that there's ghouls and god knows what else down there. Shouldn't we find out?;Part II
1464;1464;ORION;ORION: Yes, we should. Maybe some arcane house could tell us how to deal with these things.;Part II
1465;1465;LAURA;LAURA: Yes. Do we have permission to enter within the next few days? Obviously we might need to be prepared.;Part II
1466;1466;ORION;ORION: Yes, do we have badges that we wear over so that they know–?;Part II
1467;1467;MATT;MATT: “I'll speak with the men. They'll let you down. If you come back, good on you. I think our business here is done.”;Part II
1468;1468;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Yes.;Part II
1469;1469;MATT;MATT: At which point, you hear muffled in the distance a loud ringing of a very loud bell.;Part II
1470;1470;(dinging);(dinging);Part II
1471;1471;At which point, he perks up a bit. “Our business here is done. Please, shove off.”;At which point, he perks up a bit. “Our business here is done. Please, shove off.”;Part II
1472;1472;SAM;SAM: Which way do we go?;Part II
1473;1473;MATT;MATT: He looks over to the two other guards who are up front. The two Carvers say, “This way.”;Part II
1474;1474;LIAM;LIAM: While he is talking I take a flask out of my cloak and approach the barrel and surreptitiously pour a little bit of it into the flask.;Part II
1475;1475;MATT;MATT: Sleight of hand check.;Part II
1476;1476;SAM;SAM: You're stealing beer?!;Part II
1477;1477;ORION;ORION: No, because we have to give it to those guards.;Part II
1478;1478;SAM;SAM: Fuck those guards, I can kill them all.;Part II
1479;1479;LAURA;LAURA: Can I talk to good old Nostoc while he's doing that?;Part II
1480;1480;MATT;MATT: He currently does not seem like the talkative type at the moment, you can certainly try.;Part II
1481;1481;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I am going to make a fumble. I am going to attempt to assist a sleight of hand with a bit of a fumble.;Part II
1482;1482;MATT;MATT: He has already rolled it.;Part II
1483;1483;LAURA;LAURA: Damn it. I am going to fall down. In front of Nostoc.;Part II
1484;1484;SAM;SAM: Oh!;Part II
1485;1485;LIAM;LIAM: 13.;Part II
1486;1486;LAURA;LAURA: I am going to fall down in front of Nostoc.;Part II
1487;1487;MARISHA;MARISHA: Come on!;Part II
1488;1488;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: He is distracted by a bell.;Part II
1489;1489;MATT;MATT: As you fill your flask–;Part II
1490;1490;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Shit. Balls. Ass.;Part II
1491;1491;MATT;MATT: You hear this loud– (clears throat).;Part II
1492;1492;LAURA;LAURA: Ow, oh my ankle! It hurts so very much.;Part II
1493;1493;MATT;MATT: This is the first time you have witnessed the pristine, delicate yet well trained palm of a dwarven hand go straight to its forehead.;Part II
1494;1494;LIAM;LIAM: I carry the flask up to his cup and refill it and say: In my kingdom when a deal is set we drink together. I would like, not much, but to pour us all a drink and agree, surely this cask is weeks' worth of drink–;Part II
1495;1495;MATT;MATT: “Get out of my office.”;Part II
1496;1496;MARISHA;MARISHA: Take the flask, take the flask.;Part II
1497;1497;LIAM;LIAM: I can see it is a cultural difference, my apologies.;Part II
1498;1498;ORION;ORION: Stop it. Just go! What are you doing?;Part II
1499;1499;LIAM;LIAM: You're one to talk!;Part II
1500;1500;ORION;ORION: I'm on the earring.;Part II
1501;1501;MATT;MATT: A second and a third bell starts going off and the guards that are waiting for you guys. They're like– They start leading you outside and as you make your way outside the main building, you can now hear voices shouting, down in the quarry below.;Part II
1502;1502;LAURA;LAURA: I lean down to one of the guards and say: What is that bell for?;Part II
1503;1503;MATT;MATT: “Something is flushing out of the quarry.”;Part II
1504;1504;LAURA;LAURA: Flushing, what does that mean?;Part II
1505;1505;MATT;MATT: “We don't know.” Some of the guards are motioning each other to follow and some of them start going down to one of the tracks that leads down to one of the nearest quarry below.;Part II
1506;1506;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Just try and like practically usher our guards in that direction, since they seem to want to go in that direction. Let's see if we can push them in that direction.;Part II
1507;1507;MATT;MATT: Okay, you guys follow down towards the quarry, you ask the guard that question and he goes, “I don't know, we've had quite a few interesting things come through.”;Part II
1508;1508;LAURA;LAURA: Like what? Oh, like what?;Part II
1509;1509;MATT;MATT: He swallows and says, “Things I can't describe.”;Part II
1510;1510;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Well, we can certainly help, lead on.;Part II
1511;1511;MARISHA;MARISHA: Is there anybody running out?;Part II
1512;1512;MATT;MATT: Not yet. As you head halfway down the quarry walkway, you begin seeing dwarves start running out of one of the large quarry tunnels.;Part II
1513;1513;MARISHA;MARISHA: I grab one of them.;Part II
1514;1514;MATT;MATT: Well, they're quite a distance from you. You're still walking down the side. They're a good 100 feet from you. They start running at you, you see blood streaking down one of their faces.;Part II
1515;1515;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yes!;Part II
1516;1516;MATT;MATT: They're charging out, one of them has a weapon and is limping, and you start seeing small green scampering things rushing through. One, two, three, four, six, ten goblins come rushing out of the tunnel.;Part II
1517;1517;SAM;SAM: Ah, I don't like these guys.;Part II
1518;1518;LAURA;LAURA: We should attack them! I string my bow.;Part II
1519;1519;MARISHA;MARISHA: Don't you have family history with them?;Part II
1520;1520;MATT;MATT: The three dwarves that are running out, one of them gets hacked down by one of the goblins and jumps on them and is tearing his neck.;Part II
1521;1521;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I take a shot. Right now.;Part II
1522;1522;LAURA;LAURA: I take a shot. I shoot it!;Part II
1523;1523;MATT;MATT: Okay, both you guys roll–;Part II
1524;1524;LIAM;LIAM: I throw a dagger.;Part II
1525;1525;MATT;MATT: You throw a dagger? Three of you, roll for attack.;Part II
1526;1526;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: 19.;Part II
1527;1527;LAURA;LAURA: 15.;Part II
1528;1528;ORION;ORION: Is there a clear area where there's a bunch of goblins running?;Part II
1529;1529;MATT;MATT: There is an open funnel towards the tunnel.;Part II
1530;1530;ORION;ORION: I'm going to throw a little Fireball, right there where those guys are.;Part II
1531;1531;MATT;MATT: Okay, you guys you all hit from this distance because goblins are puny little things. They're still a little small to see, but you're all pretty well trained and pretty honed with your aim. You fire simultaneously, gunshot echo through the hallway, arrows, flying dagger, you see three goblins fall off a nearby dwarf who goes, “Thank–” At which point a large fireball explodes, killing off about ten or so of the goblins and probably two of the dwarves.;Part II
1532;1532;ORION;ORION: Sorry about that!;Part II
1533;1533;MATT;MATT: The guards stopped.;Part II
1534;1534;SAM;SAM: Did you do that?;Part II
1535;1535;ORION;ORION: Yeah.;Part II
1536;1536;SAM;SAM: Fuck.;Part II
1537;1537;MATT;MATT: They start looking around and they see you pull out your weapons and they all take a step back and realize they don't want to die either. “Well go, if you're going to help, go!”;Part II
1538;1538;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: We run straight in.;Part II
1539;1539;MATT;MATT: With you guys charging in, you can now see a handful more goblins are rushing out. They are like running really fast, sprinting.;Part II
1540;1540;MARISHA;MARISHA: I throw Entangle up, in the distance wherever they're coming from.;Part II
1541;1541;MATT;MATT: Okay, what's the radius on that?;Part II
1542;1542;MARISHA;MARISHA: Like a hundred feet.;Part II
1543;1543;MATT;MATT: That's the range. What is the radius?;Part II
1544;1544;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, 20-foot radius.;Part II
1545;1545;MATT;MATT: Okay. You find a portion of the central point where the things exit from the tunnel and these strange reddish vines begin to protrude and to begin to grab nearby goblins and pull them up in this massive, weird vine creature. You hear (stomping) and you now see two larger ogre-like creatures come storming out.;Part II
1546;1546;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, shit!;Part II
1547;1547;ORION;ORION: Wonderful!;Part II
1548;1548;MATT;MATT: Everyone roll initiative.;Part II
1549;1549;(cheering);(cheering);Part II
1550;1550;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, fuck. Goddamn it.;Part II
1551;1551;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Oh yeah!;Part II
1552;1552;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Take it!;Part II
1553;1553;MATT;MATT: All right, do we have initiatives 25 to 20?;Part II
1554;1554;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: 27.;Part II
1555;1555;ORION;ORION: 21.;Part II
1556;1556;LAURA;LAURA: Wait! I didn't roll yet.;Part II
1557;1557;MARISHA;MARISHA: You rolled a 20?;Part II
1558;1558;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I rolled a 20 plus seven.;Part II
1559;1559;MATT;MATT: 21, you said?;Part II
1560;1560;ORION;ORION: I have 21.;Part II
1561;1561;MATT;MATT: 21 for Tiberius. What did you get? One? Aw.;Part II
1562;1562;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, I rolled a two.;Part II
1563;1563;LIAM;LIAM: It's six with the plus.;Part II
1564;1564;SAM;SAM: Fellows. I don't like goblins.;Part II
1565;1565;LAURA;LAURA: 18.;Part II
1566;1566;MATT;MATT: You now see Scanlan, who's usually a jovial individual, his eyes begin to tense with fury.;Part II
1567;1567;SAM;SAM: I don't like goblins.;Part II
1568;1568;MARISHA;MARISHA: Is there anything that you know?;Part II
1569;1569;SAM;SAM: No, they will all die. Don't spare any of them.;Part II
1570;1570;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Copy that.;Part II
1571;1571;LAURA;LAURA: 18.;Part II
1572;1572;MATT;MATT: All right, so we have–;Part II
1573;1573;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: 18, too.;Part II
1574;1574;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: 27!;Part II
1575;1575;LAURA;LAURA: What?!;Part II
1576;1576;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, buddy.;Part II
1577;1577;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I have 27 initiative.;Part II
1578;1578;MATT;MATT: 15 to ten? Ten to five? Six.;Part II
1579;1579;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Wow, oh my god.;Part II
1580;1580;SAM;SAM: I got a three.;Part II
1581;1581;MATT;MATT: Okay. All right.;Part II
1582;1582;MARISHA;MARISHA: Four.;Part II
1583;1583;LIAM;LIAM: It was a sudden attack, man.;Part II
1584;1584;SAM;SAM: We weren't ready.;Part II
1585;1585;MATT;MATT: You got a three.;Part II
1586;1586;MARISHA;MARISHA: To be fair I just cast Entangle. It works. I'm distracted holding Entangle.;Part II
1587;1587;MATT;MATT: Yeah, it's fine. Then we have Scanlan. I'll get you guys in placement here, as your bear is currently back at the inn.;Part II
1588;1588;LAURA;LAURA: He is still?;Part II
1589;1589;MATT;MATT: Unless you wanted to bring him along.;Part II
1590;1590;LAURA;LAURA: Well, I thought I brought him. I should have mentioned that.;Part II
1591;1591;MATT;MATT: All right, we'll say you brought him along. That's fine.;Part II
1592;1592;LAURA;LAURA: I'm sorry, I should have emphasized that more.;Part II
1593;1593;MATT;MATT: That's all right. Those of you going first, we're going to keep you on the field here.;Part II
1594;1594;LAURA;LAURA: Oh god.;Part II
1595;1595;MATT;MATT: A number of goblins that are currently held over here.;Part II
1596;1596;LAURA;LAURA: They're easy. Goblins are easy. Orcs are not.;Part II
1597;1597;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, those are mine.;Part II
1598;1598;LAURA;LAURA: Ogres?!;Part II
1599;1599;MATT;MATT: Top of the round, Percy you're up.;Part II
1600;1600;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I'm sitting down and I'm busting out Bad News.;Part II
1601;1601;MARISHA;MARISHA: Bust out Bad News!;Part II
1602;1602;MATT;MATT: Percy stops just as he gets to the quarry, a little bit elevated, and he pulls out from a small sack on his back this large elongated contraption, this weird construction that looks similar to the pepperbox he usually carries, but much larger and cumbersome. He sets it up on the ground with a small stand at the front and preps itself with a visual point.;Part II
1603;1603;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Ogre.;Part II
1604;1604;MATT;MATT: Ogre back here?;Part II
1605;1605;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Yep.;Part II
1606;1606;MATT;MATT: All right, roll for your attack with Bad News.;Part II
1607;1607;MARISHA;MARISHA: Have you used it before?;Part II
1608;1608;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Nope, first time.;Part II
1609;1609;MATT;MATT: His own tinkered construction, Bad News.;Part II
1610;1610;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: That's a 30 attack.;Part II
1611;1611;MATT;MATT: Yep, that'll do it. Go ahead and roll damage.;Part II
1612;1612;MARISHA;MARISHA: Does that critical for you?;Part II
1613;1613;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: 19 actually might.;Part II
1614;1614;MATT;MATT: Natural 19?;Part II
1615;1615;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Natural 19.;Part II
1616;1616;MATT;MATT: Yeah, that should critical for you.;Part II
1617;1617;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: That does critical for me. I've never criticaled with this either. What does that mean?;Part II
1618;1618;MATT;MATT: That means the damage dice you double. Roll for damage, double that, and add your modifier after that.;Part II
1619;1619;MARISHA;MARISHA: Come on! Big money, no whammies. Yeah! Hell yeah!;Part II
1620;1620;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: (counting) 27 points of damage.;Part II
1621;1621;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Get after it, big man!;Part II
1622;1622;MARISHA;MARISHA: Is that doubled?;Part II
1623;1623;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: That's doubled.;Part II
1624;1624;MATT;MATT: You guys hear this cacophonous, large blasting sound, a flash of blue energy and sparks shoot out the back of the weapon. It actually lifts Percy off the ground for a second and he shifts himself from the sheer blast. This streaking, heated bullet, reddish, white hot, goes cascading through the air, plunges into the side of the ogre's shoulder with a smattering of blood splattering against the cave behind it. It's actually moved back a step and has to catch itself. Slams its club into the ground. That ends your turn?;Part II
1625;1625;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I can't do anything after that. That's just reload.;Part II
1626;1626;MATT;MATT: Tiberius, you're up.;Part II
1627;1627;ORION;ORION: I move within 60 feet of those big fellows.;Part II
1628;1628;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Bad news travels far and fast.;Part II
1629;1629;MARISHA;MARISHA: Nothing travels faster.;Part II
1630;1630;MATT;MATT: This is the entanglement, by the way.;Part II
1631;1631;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, okay.;Part II
1632;1632;ORION;ORION: Right before there.;Part II
1633;1633;MATT;MATT: Everything there is fighting from the entanglement. Most of these goblins are currently inside of it.;Part II
1634;1634;ORION;ORION: I'm going to shoot a Scorching Ray at the big guy.;Part II
1635;1635;MATT;MATT: Both of them?;Part II
1636;1636;SAM;SAM: He said he moved within 60 feet of them.;Part II
1637;1637;MATT;MATT: You moved up to here? All righty.;Part II
1638;1638;MARISHA;MARISHA: They're all entangled, yeah?;Part II
1639;1639;ORION;ORION: That's good right there.;Part II
1640;1640;MARISHA;MARISHA: Still have Entagle up.;Part II
1641;1641;MATT;MATT: These guys here are entangled. These front goblins are not. Scorching Ray you said at which ones?;Part II
1642;1642;ORION;ORION: Actually, oh there's a bunch of those dudes, aren't there? I'm going to do a Fireball instead, right in the center of the juiciness where I can get a couple little guys and both the big guys.;Part II
1643;1643;MATT;MATT: All right, so I'd probably about there would be where you'd want it.;Part II
1644;1644;ORION;ORION: I'm going to do that, and I'm going to spend two sorcerer points immediately to do quickening spell and do another spell right after that.;Part II
1645;1645;MATT;MATT: Okay. As you rush up, you pull back your hand and you see the arcane red energy begin to flow in your palm. You then throw the beam out, and it arcs, slams into the center, and explodes hitting each of these five goblins and the two ogres. What's your DC on your spell?;Part II
1646;1646;ORION;ORION: My DC on my spell is–;Part II
1647;1647;MATT;MATT: Top of your spell page on the right.;Part II
1648;1648;ORION;ORION: Oh! Wait. Oh! 17, sorry.;Part II
1649;1649;MATT;MATT: 17, okay. Wow! The two ogres actually make their saving throws.;Part II
1650;1650;LAURA;LAURA: Ugh!;Part II
1651;1651;MARISHA;MARISHA: Boo!;Part II
1652;1652;MATT;MATT: They got 18 and a 19.;Part II
1653;1653;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Roll crappier, ogres!;Part II
1654;1654;MATT;MATT: The goblins, however, all disintegrate.;Part II
1655;1655;LAURA;LAURA: All of them?;Part II
1656;1656;MATT;MATT: There's no way they're going to survive the damage you– they (poofing). You see this hint of a red ash mist go, (squeaking) where they once were, and they are all turned to black nothingness. However, roll damage for the ogres. They get half damage because they made their reflex save. So 8d6 damage.;Part II
1657;1657;SAM;SAM: 8d6.;Part II
1658;1658;SAM;SAM: (counting) 27!;Part II
1659;1659;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: What?!;Part II
1660;1660;MATT;MATT: 27, so half that. As the blast of fire dissipates, you can see one of the ogres is now burnt on half of its chest. Looking a little rough. There's blood streaking down from the side of his face where the shrapnel got thrown at him. The other ogre's looking okay.;Part II
1661;1661;ORION;ORION: He's a large creature isn't he?;Part II
1662;1662;MATT;MATT: Yes.;Part II
1663;1663;ORION;ORION: I'm going to use my second spell and do Telekinesis and pick one up and try to hurl him into the other one.;Part II
1664;1664;MATT;MATT: Okay. Which one? The one left here?;Part II
1665;1665;ORION;ORION: The one that's beaten up already.;Part II
1666;1666;SAM;SAM: I'm hard right now!;Part II
1667;1667;MATT;MATT: He does fail his saving throw. You lift him up in the air and throw him into that. That ogre is knocked prone by the impact.;Part II
1668;1668;ALL;ALL: Yeah!;Part II
1669;1669;MATT;MATT: The other one is also knocked prone. Before (splatting) into the wall, both of them slam to the ground.;Part II
1670;1670;MARISHA;MARISHA: With my vines, I make sure my vines really grapple him.;Part II
1671;1671;ORION;ORION: I turn to Grog: They're all yours, buddy!;Part II
1672;1672;MATT;MATT: Go ahead and roll 2d6 impact damage for the force of the throw.;Part II
1673;1673;ORION;ORION: Sweet! Impact damage? Ten.;Part II
1674;1674;MATT;MATT: Ten damage to each of them?;Part II
1675;1675;ORION;ORION: Yeah.;Part II
1676;1676;MATT;MATT: All right. Both of the ogres are now on the ground reeling from the impact. That brings us to Grog and Vex going simultaneously.;Part II
1677;1677;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Ladies first.;Part II
1678;1678;LAURA;LAURA: Oh! Well, all right. I'm going to cast Hunter's Mark on the most damaged one.;Part II
1679;1679;MATT;MATT: Okay, that'd be this one here.;Part II
1680;1680;LAURA;LAURA: All right. Then I'm going to shoot Lightning Arrow.;Part II
1681;1681;MATT;MATT: All right. Do you want to move a little closer?;Part II
1682;1682;LAURA;LAURA: Yes, I do.;Part II
1683;1683;MATT;MATT: All right. That would put you right there.;Part II
1684;1684;LAURA;LAURA: All right, cool. I'm going to shoot Lightning Arrow at them.;Part II
1685;1685;MATT;MATT: Okay. You pull out your arrow and as you pull it back, a little bit of energy courses through your fingers, strikes through your arrow. You can now see this crackling energy as you're pulling it taut in your bow. You let it loose, roll for attack.;Part II
1686;1686;LAURA;LAURA: Okay! 21!;Part II
1687;1687;MATT;MATT: 21 hits.;Part II
1688;1688;LAURA;LAURA: All right. Then I do something else. 1d8. Right?;Part II
1689;1689;MATT;MATT: Yep. You do the damage of the arrow plus the damage of the spell.;Part II
1690;1690;LAURA;LAURA: Holy moly! So that's this. 13 for the arrow and then 4d8 for the spell. (counting) 17!;Part II
1691;1691;MATT;MATT: 17. Okay. The ogre that's been beaten, blasted by the fireball, it's getting up– (grunt). It grabs its club, and it begins to get up on one leg as the Lightning Arrow slams into its chest. You can see it hits. Looks down for a second, and then the charge pulses through its entire torso. As it does, it screams out, “Ugh!” into the cavern, its whole muscle system locks tight and it falls forward again, onto its chest, smoke rising off of its whole upper area, unmoving, on the ground. He is gone.;Part II
1692;1692;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Dang! Come on now!;Part II
1693;1693;LAURA;LAURA: Yes! Then the other one takes 2d8 if he fails his saving throw.;Part II
1694;1694;MATT;MATT: Which, with a one, he does.;Part II
1695;1695;LAURA;LAURA: Yes! Oh, he fails it so good.;Part II
1696;1696;MATT;MATT: Go ahead a roll damage for other ogre.;Part II
1697;1697;LAURA;LAURA: Two. ten.;Part II
1698;1698;MATT;MATT: Ten damage. Nice. As he falls to the ground, the arc arcs over to the other one who drops his club for a second. Picks it up angrily.;Part II
1699;1699;LAURA;LAURA: I can reassign my Hunter's Mark to him now?;Part II
1700;1700;MATT;MATT: You can.;Part II
1701;1701;LAURA;LAURA: Yes.;Part II
1702;1702;MATT;MATT: Yes, all right. That brings us to–;Part II
1703;1703;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, my Hunter's Mark! I didn't do my Hunter's Mark damage. But it doesn't matter. He's dead.;Part II
1704;1704;MATT;MATT: It doesn't matter. You killed him.;Part II
1705;1705;LAURA;LAURA: All right, cool.;Part II
1706;1706;MATT;MATT: You just ultra killed him! (valley girl voice) He is so dead. Oh my god. This ogre is done. (normal voice) All right. The other ogre's angry. It's now the goblins' turn. These goblins rush up. They are dashing forward.;Part II
1707;1707;MARISHA;MARISHA: (valley girl voice) They are so dead.;Part II
1708;1708;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: (valley girl voice) They're just, like, dead. This one moves around, and this one runs around to there. No attacks. Everyone make an insight check.;Part II
1709;1709;SAM;SAM: Insight check? Oh shit.;Part II
1710;1710;MARISHA;MARISHA: What happened? Why are we doing this?;Part II
1711;1711;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I literally get a one.;Part II
1712;1712;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: (sings) Natural 20! On an insight check.;Part II
1713;1713;MARISHA;MARISHA: 20 total. 20.;Part II
1714;1714;LAURA;LAURA: 22.;Part II
1715;1715;ORION;ORION: Four.;Part II
1716;1716;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Natural one. I'm really not paying attention.;Part II
1717;1717;MATT;MATT: You're dealing with the fact that you just fired your gun for the first time and it burned your hands a little. You're like “Ugh!”;Part II
1718;1718;SAM and MATT;SAM and MATT: Grog.;Part II
1719;1719;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Recites poetry.;Part II
1720;1720;MATT;MATT: Grog is familiar with one thing, fear in the eyes of his enemies. Looking at these goblins, they're not charging to attack. The attacks seem to be instinctual. They are running.;Part II
1721;1721;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, no!;Part II
1722;1722;MATT;MATT: They are scared.;Part II
1723;1723;LAURA;LAURA: Yes!;Part II
1724;1724;MATT;MATT: They are fleeing from something.;Part II
1725;1725;SAM;SAM: From the ogres?;Part II
1726;1726;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Something behind the ogres.;Part II
1727;1727;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, no.;Part II
1728;1728;SAM;SAM: May I make a request that you kill them anyway?;Part II
1729;1729;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: It's like playing croquet at this point, so yes.;Part II
1730;1730;(laughter);(laughter);Part II
1731;1731;MATT;MATT: Grog, it's your turn.;Part II
1732;1732;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I would like to rage! And I would like to move to the right of all those stinking goblins!;Part II
1733;1733;MATT;MATT: Right over here?;Part II
1734;1734;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, a little more to the right. Yeah, a little more. Yeah, keep going. All the way flanking it there. Yeah. Yeah, and then I would like to give them the cleanest shave possible with my greataxe.;Part II
1735;1735;MATT;MATT: All right. Go ahead and roll for attack on the first one.;Part II
1736;1736;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: 18 plus eight. That's 26?;Part II
1737;1737;MATT;MATT: That definitively hits. Go ahead and roll damage.;Part II
1738;1738;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh, damage, crap.;Part II
1739;1739;LIAM;LIAM: (sings) Decapitation!;Part II
1740;1740;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Two plus the four. 13!;Part II
1741;1741;MATT;MATT: 13? Okay. As you rush up, you bring your axe into the first goblin to your right (whoosh) clean. You don't even feel resistance. You hear this little (wheeze) sound as this being is bisected.;Part II
1742;1742;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh, that was cute.;Part II
1743;1743;MATT;MATT: Its head and upper torso rolling off to the side before rolling to a stop. However, the inertia of your axe still keeps through to the one on the other side of you. Go ahead and roll for your second attack on that.;Part II
1744;1744;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: 21!;Part II
1745;1745;MATT;MATT: Also hits, go ahead and roll damage.;Part II
1746;1746;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh, that was eight plus seven is 15!;Part II
1747;1747;MATT;MATT: As you cleave through the first goblin, you swing around, another goblin looks up at you, scared, and pulls a dagger out with its gnarled tongue, (hisses), at which point the axe embeds itself straight into its face. Its angry face goes, “Ugh!” and falls slack against your blade. You lift backward, and it's stuck to the edge of your axe. Just limply dangling against– you shake it off a little bit.;Part II
1748;1748;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Double prizes! Yeah!;Part II
1749;1749;MATT;MATT: Great. That ends your turn. The thing about rage is that you can use your bonus action for a third attack. If you wanted to do a frenzy action, but you don't need to. That brings us to the ogre's turn. The ogre gets up, let's see if it makes its saving throw for an attempt to get out. It does with an 18. However, the ogre gets about that far. It's going to make a double move.;Part II
1750;1750;LAURA;LAURA: Double move?!;Part II
1751;1751;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: He's running.;Part II
1752;1752;MARISHA;MARISHA: I still have Entangle up.;Part II
1753;1753;MATT;MATT: I know. He managed to resist it.;Part II
1754;1754;LAURA;LAURA: He saved against it.;Part II
1755;1755;MATT;MATT: It's a big ogre.;Part II
1756;1756;MARISHA;MARISHA: Poop.;Part II
1757;1757;MATT;MATT: The ogre takes his full turn to get up in melee with you guys. It does not have its attack since it used its full movement there. Once again, you see as it's lumbering forward, it also has this look in its eye of desperation.;Part II
1758;1758;SAM;SAM: Oh crap.;Part II
1759;1759;ORION;ORION: We should just let it pass.;Part II
1760;1760;MATT;MATT: Now it is Vax's go.;Part II
1761;1761;LIAM;LIAM: My sister's right in the face of the ogre, correct?;Part II
1762;1762;MATT;MATT: Correct.;Part II
1763;1763;LIAM;LIAM: Excellent. I'm going to take a run towards my sister, since she's right close to him, he's distracted so I'm going to turn just as I get to her, so my back presses against hers and swing around and sneak attack two daggers up in his belly.;Part II
1764;1764;LAURA;LAURA: We've practiced this, I turn.;Part II
1765;1765;MATT;MATT: All right. As you dodge to the side, this blur of shadow and speed, you coast up to the side of your sister, dagger both plunge towards the side of the ogre. Go ahead and roll for an attack.;Part II
1766;1766;LIAM;LIAM: All right. One. Then the other one I do a poison dagger, gets a (singing) 20!;Part II
1767;1767;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh, put it on him brother!;Part II
1768;1768;MATT;MATT: All right.;Part II
1769;1769;LIAM;LIAM: That is dagger of venom, 1d4. Three, plus two is five, and then is the sneak attack damage go with–?;Part II
1770;1770;MATT;MATT: Yeah it does because you have another ally adjacent to it. You don't get advantage on the attack roll, but you can still do the sneak attack.;Part II
1771;1771;LIAM;LIAM: Critical hit, too, as well, wouldn't it?;Part II
1772;1772;MATT;MATT: Yeah! You can multiply the sneak attack damage.;Part II
1773;1773;LIAM;LIAM: Five, plus- and the double goes to the sneak attack damage?;Part II
1774;1774;MATT;MATT: It does. Modifiers don't double, but any dice you roll double.;Part II
1775;1775;LIAM;LIAM: Nine, 15–;Part II
1776;1776;MATT;MATT: In my game. (clicks tongue);Part II
1777;1777;LIAM;LIAM: So 30 plus five, 35.;Part II
1778;1778;MATT;MATT: 35 damage.;Part II
1779;1779;LIAM;LIAM: Plus poison.;Part II
1780;1780;MATT;MATT: The poison's not going to factor in. You swing past her, both blades jam right into the side of its rib cage. You hear it howl out in pain. As it does, you twist the daggers in a way where both blades are now going in two different directions, and you carve out a section of its entire abdomen. As you do, the flesh, like whale blubber, sloughs off the sides of it. Organs spill out, intestines, and it looks down and tries to pull them back in. You see the color draining from its face, and you lean up and kick it down. The ogre and falls to the ground lifeless, destroyed.;Part II
1781;1781;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: You gave him just enough time to regret everything that had ever happened.;Part II
1782;1782;MATT;MATT: Yes.;Part II
1783;1783;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Well done. Bad life choices.;Part II
1784;1784;MATT;MATT: That brings us to Keyleth.;Part II
1785;1785;MARISHA;MARISHA: I didn't call my mom enough.;Part II
1786;1786;LAURA;LAURA: There are two goblins left?;Part II
1787;1787;MATT;MATT: There are two goblins left.;Part II
1788;1788;MARISHA;MARISHA: Okay. I do a quick sprint jog up towards Grog and go (boof) and bring up a big stone wall. Right where that entrance is.;Part II
1789;1789;MATT;MATT: Right here?;Part II
1790;1790;MARISHA;MARISHA: No. Like, right where things are pouring out.;Part II
1791;1791;MATT;MATT: Right, here?;Part II
1792;1792;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yeah.;Part II
1793;1793;MATT;MATT: All right, Wall of Stone.;Part II
1794;1794;MARISHA;MARISHA: Wall of Stone– boom.;Part II
1795;1795;MATT;MATT: All right. A giant wall of stone now completely seals off that part of the mine.;Part II
1796;1796;MARISHA;MARISHA: We don't know what's in there, we should talk about this for a second, and I bought us some time. I'm sure it's going to try to beat through that door in a second.;Part II
1797;1797;MATT;MATT: I'm going to say that you moved up to there with your movement. All right, I'd say probably over here, not right next to the goblins and that will give you enough range. Okay, so the wall of stone–;Part II
1798;1798;(boom);(boom);Part II
1799;1799;MARISHA;MARISHA: Are there any guards around still? Any dwarven guards?;Part II
1800;1800;MATT;MATT: They are all watching you do this now. They don't want to put their lives at risk, and you guys seem intent on getting into the middle of this battle, so they are going to sit back and let you do it.;Part II
1801;1801;MARISHA;MARISHA: I throw up my wall and turn around and I say: What's coming?! Tell us! You know what's coming. What's coming?!;Part II
1802;1802;MATT;MATT: Make an intimidation check.;Part II
1803;1803;LAURA;LAURA: Keyleth, you are so hardcore.;Part II
1804;1804;MARISHA;MARISHA: I'm not good at this.;Part II
1805;1805;SAM;SAM: You speak goblin?;Part II
1806;1806;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh, four.;Part II
1807;1807;(laughter and groaning);(laughter and groaning);Part II
1808;1808;MARISHA;MARISHA: (tearfully) What's coming?;Part II
1809;1809;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Make a pity roll.;Part II
1810;1810;MATT;MATT: A very gentle attempt at intimidation, however, the message gets across. The guards look at you, taken off guard.;Part II
1811;1811;MARISHA;MARISHA: We are about to die. It is in your best interest to tell us.;Part II
1812;1812;MATT;MATT: “We don't know! It's been different things. Strange abominations. It's hard to describe. They're put together. Something's making things down there.”;Part II
1813;1813;MARISHA;MARISHA: What kind of things? From where?;Part II
1814;1814;MATT;MATT: As they're talking, you hear a (boom) against the stone.;Part II
1815;1815;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: (clicking) Sitting down.;Part II
1816;1816;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: I bring out my blade.;Part II
1817;1817;MATT;MATT: The stone cracks, and you can see a noticeable crack and an audible (cracking).;Part II
1818;1818;LIAM;LIAM: I'm running right now diagonally towards the wall and I press against the wall.;Part II
1819;1819;LAURA;LAURA: Oh, good call. I do the same thing on the other side.;Part II
1820;1820;MATT;MATT: Okay, so you come over here. Do you want to bring Trinket with you?;Part II
1821;1821;LAURA;LAURA: Yeah!;Part II
1822;1822;MATT;MATT: All right.;Part II
1823;1823;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: You're all so fancy.;Part II
1824;1824;MARISHA;MARISHA: I cast Stoneskin on myself.;Part II
1825;1825;LAURA;LAURA: We're stealthing, I'm stealthing.;Part II
1826;1826;MATT;MATT: Roll stealth both of you.;Part II
1827;1827;ORION;ORION: How tall are the walls? I mean the ceiling.;Part II
1828;1828;MATT;MATT: Oh, the ceiling right now is the rest of Kraghammer for the most part.;Part II
1829;1829;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Hundreds.;Part II
1830;1830;MATT;MATT: Yeah, it is a huge ceiling.;Part II
1831;1831;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: What's in the middle? Are those fires?;Part II
1832;1832;MATT;MATT: These are braziers here. By the way, Stoneskin goes, this disappears.;Part II
1833;1833;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: The entanglement?;Part II
1834;1834;MATT;MATT: Yeah, the entanglement is gone. There are minecarts, some rocks, there is a smashed cart over here from when the ogre barreled through. This is a piece of stone that rises about 15 feet, and these are both braziers for light in the center of the area. Yeah, it's hundreds and hundreds of feet up. You can look up to the very top of Kraghammer from here.;Part II
1835;1835;ORION;ORION: Okay, that's fine.;Part II
1836;1836;MATT;MATT: Whatcha got? Well, let's see. Keyleth, that's your turn, Stoneskin and moving up. Anywhere else you want to go? Right now, we're technically not in combat.;Part II
1837;1837;SAM;SAM: Right. We're out of combat.;Part II
1838;1838;MATT;MATT: Briefly.;Part II
1839;1839;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I'm breathing deep, taking aim at the wall, resetting everything.;Part II
1840;1840;MARISHA;MARISHA: Can I move up behind that pillar?;Part II
1841;1841;MATT;MATT: Okay.;Part II
1842;1842;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I'm staying far back at the moment.;Part II
1843;1843;MATT;MATT: Back here. Both of these goblins– I'll just say that you guys end up taking them down. It's not even a question. You step on them and crush them.;Part II
1844;1844;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Are there any dwarves that we can say to go get Ballsack and bring him down?;Part II
1845;1845;MATT;MATT: You can.;Part II
1846;1846;LAURA;LAURA: Oh yeah, Balgoos! Balgus.;Part II
1847;1847;MATT;MATT: Balgus? You tell them, “Get Balgus!” and they're like, “Who?” Some of them have set crossbows up by the way. They're barreling down to get ready to fire at whatever comes through. (impact) Another crack in the wall. You can see the dust settle as the stone cracks again and a large piece at the top tumbles off. The stone wall's probably not going to hold another impact. Anybody else want to move anywhere?;Part II
1848;1848;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Just taking aim.;Part II
1849;1849;SAM;SAM: I'll move up to the right near where Grog is. No one's has taken any damage yet, right?;Part II
1850;1850;MATT;MATT: Not currently, no. You guys have had a pretty clean sweep into this battle, so far.;Part II
1851;1851;SAM;SAM: I can't inspire anybody here? Now?;Part II
1852;1852;MATT;MATT: You can inspire anybody. Just give them a dice.;Part II
1853;1853;SAM;SAM: Can I inspire everyone?;Part II
1854;1854;MATT;MATT: You can spend all your uses to inspire as many people as you have the uses of it.;Part II
1855;1855;MARISHA;MARISHA: I still have mine that I haven't used yet.;Part II
1856;1856;SAM;SAM: I'll inspire Vex and Vax and Grog.;Part II
1857;1857;SAM;SAM: (singing) I think you're really handsome and nice! You're going to have inspiration dice!;Part II
1858;1858;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Thought you were going to have a little–;Part II
1859;1859;LAURA;LAURA: I know, some beautiful song for us! Wait, what for all of us? We all get a d8?;Part II
1860;1860;MATT;MATT: Each of you has to have a single d8 dice, inspiration dice. The bardic inspiration is flowing through you, that you can use to add to an attack roll, not damage. You can add it to an attack roll, a saving throw.;Part II
1861;1861;SAM;SAM: (plays tune on electric piano app);Part II
1862;1862;MATT;MATT: There you go. That's what a shawm sounds like, apparently. You can use it on attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability check. Any skill. Tiberius, are you going to stay where you are, are you moving anywhere? Last chance.;Part II
1863;1863;ORION;ORION: Is that cover right there next to me?;Part II
1864;1864;MATT;MATT: Right over here? Yeah.;Part II
1865;1865;ORION;ORION: I'll get behind the cover. I'm going to peek out and I'm going to cast Blur.;Part II
1866;1866;MATT;MATT: Okay, Stoneskin goes away.;Part II
1867;1867;ORION;ORION: I can't do both?;Part II
1868;1868;MATT;MATT: Nope. They're both concentration spells.;Part II
1869;1869;ORION;ORION: Okay, I leave Stoneskin.;Part II
1870;1870;MATT;MATT: Okay, Stoneskin stays on. At which point (boom) the stone breaks through scattering across the ground. Immediately bursting through–;Part II
1871;1871;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: What the fuck is that?;Part II
1872;1872;LAURA;LAURA: What is it?;Part II
1873;1873;MATT;MATT: A bulbous, oversized, naga-like creature. You've encountered a naga before, which is a large serpentine creature with a humanoid head. However, this one is swollen, it is bulbous. The way it moves looks unnatural and it has affixed to it not one, not three, but five other different colored naga heads stitched to its body. It is a seriously terrible abomination. As it breaks through the stone, (hisses and growls) all the heads rear back.;Part II
1874;1874;MARISHA;MARISHA: Do naga heads do something if you look at them?;Part II
1875;1875;MATT;MATT: We're beginning back at the top of the initiative order.;Part II
1876;1876;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh shit!;Part II
1877;1877;LAURA;LAURA: Wait! I got a question! My Hunter's Mark, can I transfer it to that thing or do I have to–;Part II
1878;1878;MATT;MATT: Correct, you can, yes. Because this still part of the encounter.;Part II
1879;1879;LAURA;LAURA: Sweet!;Part II
1880;1880;MATT;MATT: That is now marked with the Hunter's Mark. Percy, you're up first.;Part II
1881;1881;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Do I have to take new aim or can I have myself already trained on–;Part II
1882;1882;MATT;MATT: You've had a moment to train. You haven't seen the creature until it just burst out, so it would take you a round to aim.;Part II
1883;1883;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I'm taking my round to aim.;Part II
1884;1884;MATT;MATT: Okay, so you're aiming. That brings us to Tiberius.;Part II
1885;1885;ORION;ORION: What did you just do?;Part II
1886;1886;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: I just took aim. Took aim. Just a gun.;Part II
1887;1887;LAURA;LAURA: Did we roll initiative again?;Part II
1888;1888;MATT;MATT: I'm keeping the same initiative order.;Part II
1889;1889;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: This gun doesn't do anything fancy. Just shoots really far, really hard.;Part II
1890;1890;ORION;ORION: Okay! I'll do a Scorching Ray.;Part II
1891;1891;MATT;MATT: Scorching Ray, all right. It makes a saving throw. It does not! Rolled a two, so full damage on it.;Part II
1892;1892;ORION;ORION: Two– four. Let's shoot two of them right now, right, three of them?;Part II
1893;1893;MATT;MATT: It's an aimed ray attack?;Part II
1894;1894;ORION;ORION: Yeah.;Part II
1895;1895;MATT;MATT: Then you have to roll for the attack. Roll a d20 and add your–;Part II
1896;1896;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Roll high, roll high.;Part II
1897;1897;MATT;MATT: Top of your spell page.;Part II
1898;1898;ORION;ORION: Oh! That's 23.;Part II
1899;1899;MATT;MATT: 23? 23 hits.;Part II
1900;1900;ORION;ORION: Yes, okay. Then that's 2d6. That's 12.;Part II
1901;1901;MATT;MATT: 12 points of damage to the naga. That brings us to–;Part II
1902;1902;ORION;ORION: Wait. I roll for the second shot, right?;Part II
1903;1903;MATT;MATT: Yeah.;Part II
1904;1904;ORION;ORION: Okay, and that's a natural 20.;Part II
1905;1905;(cheering);(cheering);Part II
1906;1906;MATT;MATT: Okay, so you fire one beam off and it slams into the side of one of the naga heads. The second you bring back and as you do there's a flicker of arcane instability. His arm shakes as he releases the surge of scorching energy as it blasts into the side of the naga. Also, does not make a saving throw again! Roll full damage.;Part II
1907;1907;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Holy shit, Tiberius.;Part II
1908;1908;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: Oh my god.;Part II
1909;1909;ORION;ORION: 12.;Part II
1910;1910;MATT;MATT: 12?;Part II
1911;1911;ORION;ORION: Yeah.;Part II
1912;1912;MATT;MATT: Multiplied? Or did you roll a 12?;Part II
1913;1913;ORION;ORION: I rolled a 12.;Part II
1914;1914;MATT;MATT: 12. Times two. 24 points of damage.;Part II
1915;1915;ORION;ORION: Oh! I'm terrible at math! Stay in school, kids!;Part II
1916;1916;MARISHA;MARISHA: This is a good time to note our charity, 826LA.;Part II
1917;1917;SAM;SAM: Not yet. Don't donate yet. Donate next week.;Part II
1918;1918;MATT;MATT: Next week, you can donate to then. All right, so that brings us to the end of Tiberius' turn. You want to move at all, are you staying where you are?;Part II
1919;1919;ORION;ORION: I'll stay right here.;Part II
1920;1920;MATT;MATT: Grog and Vex, you're up.;Part II
1921;1921;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Ladies first.;Part II
1922;1922;LAURA;LAURA: Oh! Me! Okay, I'm going to shoot– oh god, I didn't realize I was going so fast.;Part II
1923;1923;MATT;MATT: What did you roll for stealth, by the way?;Part II
1924;1924;LAURA;LAURA: What?;Part II
1925;1925;MATT;MATT: What did you roll for stealth, by the way?;Part II
1926;1926;LAURA;LAURA: I rolled a 20 for stealth!;Part II
1927;1927;MATT;MATT: Then yeah, he has no idea you're there.;Part II
1928;1928;LAURA;LAURA: Sweet!;Part II
1929;1929;MATT;MATT: He sees the bear going (growling).;Part II
1930;1930;LAURA;LAURA: Okay. Trinket's going to hang out because I don't want to– you know. I'm going to shoot Conjure Barrage. No, I'm just going to shoot him twice.;Part II
1931;1931;MATT;MATT: All right, go for it!;Part II
1932;1932;LAURA;LAURA: All right.;Part II
1933;1933;MATT;MATT: Arrow once, arrow twice, Legolas style.;Part II
1934;1934;LAURA;LAURA: I am going to do the fire arrow thingy at it.;Part II
1935;1935;MATT;MATT: Okay, so using your bowstring.;Part II
1936;1936;LAURA;LAURA: The blazing bowstring. Thank you, Tiberius!;Part II
1937;1937;MATT;MATT: That he created and crafted! All right so as you pull the second arrow out you nock it. As you let it, go it bursts into flames arcing halfway through the air.;Part II
1938;1938;LAURA;LAURA: Okay.;Part II
1939;1939;MATT;MATT: What was your to hit roll on that?;Part II
1940;1940;LAURA;LAURA: 21?;Part II
1941;1941;MATT;MATT: 21 hits!;Part II
1942;1942;LAURA;LAURA: Oh wait, that's four plus seven is 11.;Part II
1943;1943;SAM;SAM: Don't forget your inspiration!;Part II
1944;1944;MATT;MATT: Well inspiration dice is to hit.;Part II
1945;1945;SAM;SAM: Oh, okay.;Part II
1946;1946;LAURA;LAURA: 11.;Part II
1947;1947;MATT;MATT: 11 points of damage.;Part II
1948;1948;LAURA;LAURA: For the first one, plus for the blazing bowstring I can turn any arrow into a flaming arrow, doing additional ten fire damage. I'll roll that right now, which is this. Which is a seven!;Part II
1949;1949;MATT;MATT: An additional seven, so 18 total damage and that arrow (impact) in the side of its body. One of the serpent heads reels back from the pain. It begins snatching at where the arrow's now protruding from it, trying to break it off.;Part II
1950;1950;LAURA;LAURA: Then I'm going to roll again! That's a 24!;Part II
1951;1951;MATT;MATT: That hits, go ahead and roll damage.;Part II
1952;1952;LAURA;LAURA: Awesome. That's an eight.;Part II
1953;1953;MATT;MATT: Grog, you're on deck.;Part II
1954;1954;LAURA;LAURA: Seven plus seven is 14!;Part II
1955;1955;MATT;"MATT: 14 damage, all right. Both arrows sink into it. Definitely piercing through the scales a little bit, but not sticking too deeply into its body; it's definitely a hearty creature. Grog, you're up!";Part II
1956;1956;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Right, I would like to run around the other side of the rock, raging, spit flying out my of my mouth! I would like to use the chain of returning, also crafted by Tiberius, attach it to the end of the greataxe, and throw it from where I am at the snake.;Part II
1957;1957;ORION;ORION: Yeah!;Part II
1958;1958;MATT;MATT: He comes running around, rears back, and takes his double-handed great axe and lobs it overhand. The chain, that's wrapped around your wrist, keeping it attached to you, in some degree. Go ahead and roll for the attack.;Part II
1959;1959;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Eight, nine, 17!;Part II
1960;1960;MATT;MATT: 17? It just hits!;Part II
1961;1961;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: All right, nice. That is 15.;Part II
1962;1962;MATT;MATT: 15 points of damage. The axe embeds itself pretty deeply into the torso.;Part II
1963;1963;LAURA;LAURA: Oh! I didn't do my Hunter's Mark.;Part II
1964;1964;MATT;MATT: Roll Hunter's Mark damage right now.;Part II
1965;1965;LAURA;LAURA: Thank you, chatroom!;Part II
1966;1966;Six!;Six!;Part II
1967;1967;MATT;MATT: Six? Awesome. Six damage. All right.;Part II
1968;1968;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: This says, “An athletics-strength check is required to pull the weapon free, the DC 12?”;Part II
1969;1969;MATT;MATT: Go ahead and roll an athletics check.;Part II
1970;1970;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: 12.;Part II
1971;1971;MATT;MATT: Roll a d20.;Part II
1972;1972;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh, a d20.;Part II
1973;1973;MATT;MATT: It's a DC 12.;Part II
1974;1974;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Shit. Balls. Taint. Five.;Part II
1975;1975;MATT;MATT: Plus–;Part II
1976;1976;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Plus what?;Part II
1977;1977;MATT;MATT: Plus your athletics!;Part II
1978;1978;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Oh! That's bound to be good. Seven! It's 12!;Part II
1979;1979;MATT;MATT: 12 is the DC! So yeah!;Part II
1980;1980;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: (elated laughter);Part II
1981;1981;MATT;MATT: You pull back the chain and as you do, the blade is resisting, it's stuck in the torso and it actually (whoosh) and flies back, and you barely catch it.;Part II
1982;1982;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: (nervous laughter);Part II
1983;1983;MARISHA;MARISHA: I love your joy sounds!;Part II
1984;1984;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Meant to do that! Meant to do that of course.;Part II
1985;1985;MATT;MATT: Now it's its turn.;Part II
1986;1986;LAURA;LAURA: Oh no!;Part II
1987;1987;MATT;MATT: (bursts of wind);Part II
1988;1988;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Yeah, come on!;Part II
1989;1989;SAM;SAM: What? Why me? No, that's not me.;Part II
1990;1990;MATT;MATT: For its size, when it moves, it moves in a burst of lightning energy. It's too fast for its corpulent form. As it goes behind to Keyleth and Tiberius, it makes an attack with each of its five heads. Two on Tiberius, three on Keyleth. Remember, you guys have Stoneskin, so I believe you have resistance against damage, right?;Part II
1991;1991;ORION;ORION: Oh yes, I do.;Part II
1992;1992;MATT;MATT: All right. So. Against Keyleth, it's a natural 20.;Part II
1993;1993;ALL;ALL: Oh no!;Part II
1994;1994;MATT;MATT: That's a 12 plus seven, that's going to be a 19 to hit?;Part II
1995;1995;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yeah.;Part II
1996;1996;MATT;MATT: Natural 20 again.;Part II
1997;1997;MARISHA;MARISHA: What the fuck!;Part II
1998;1998;MATT;MATT: Two critical hits, and a hit on you.;Part II
1999;1999;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: What is this bullshit?;Part II
2000;2000;MATT;MATT: On Tiberius, that's a 22 to hit and a 13 to hit.;Part II
2001;2001;ORION;ORION: One does, one does not.;Part II
2002;2002;MATT;MATT: Okay, cool. Against Keyleth, you take–;Part II
2003;2003;MARISHA;MARISHA: I'm glad I cast Stoneskin.;Part II
2004;2004;MATT;MATT: I know. So you take half damage for these. Which is fine.;Part II
2005;2005;MARISHA;MARISHA: Yeah.;Part II
2006;2006;MATT;MATT: That's two plus four, that's six, damage halved, you take three damage. Oh, sorry. Three multiplied by two because it's a critical. So you take six damage from the first strike.;Part II
2007;2007;LAURA;LAURA: That's nothing! Six damage.;Part II
2008;2008;MATT;MATT: Not too bad. You take seven damage from the second strike, and another six damage from the 3rd strike. Actually, it would have been six, four and six. Because you have resistance on the damage because of Stoneskin.;Part II
2009;2009;MARISHA;MARISHA: Six, four and six?;Part II
2010;2010;MATT;MATT: Yes. However, make a constitution saving throw. As venom from the fangs of the naga begin to pulse into your bloodstream.;Part II
2011;2011;MARISHA;MARISHA: I should have taken the poison resistance. He talked me out of it. What am I–constitution.;Part II
2012;2012;MATT;MATT: Yeah, constitution saving throw.;Part II
2013;2013;MARISHA;MARISHA: Fuck!;Part II
2014;2014;MATT;MATT: Natural one? Natural one on the constitution saving throw.;Part II
2015;2015;LAURA;LAURA: Oh no!;Part II
2016;2016;MARISHA;MARISHA: It's a bad day.;Part II
2017;2017;MATT;MATT: You feel this burning pain pulse into your bloodstream, as your whole body doubles over from the pain.;Part II
2018;2018;SAM;SAM: Keyleth dies in episode one.;Part II
2019;2019;MATT;MATT: You suffer 31 points of poison damage.;Part II
2020;2020;MARISHA;MARISHA: 31, on top of the six, four and six?;Part II
2021;2021;MATT;MATT: Yep.;Part II
2022;2022;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Are you okay?;Part II
2023;2023;MATT;MATT: The poison damage is not halved because it is not a physical attack on your body.;Part II
2024;2024;LAURA;LAURA: Is Keyleth unconscious?;Part II
2025;2025;SAM;SAM: No, she's okay.;Part II
2026;2026;MATT;MATT: Tiberius you take 13 points of damage halved by Stoneskin so you take a total of seven. Also make a constitution saving throw.;Part II
2027;2027;Whatcha got?;Whatcha got?;Part II
2028;2028;ORION;ORION: It's a 16.;Part II
2029;2029;MATT;MATT: 16, you manage to physically resist the poison in your system. You feel that slight tinge, the muscles tense, but then your dragonborn form begins to shrug off the effect of the venom.;Part II
2030;2030;ORION;ORION: Can I turn to him and blow fire out of my nostrils?;Part II
2031;2031;MATT;MATT: Sure.;Part II
2032;2032;ORION;ORION: That's what I do.;Part II
2033;2033;MATT;MATT: True dragonborn challenge. That brings us to Vax.;Part II
2034;2034;LIAM;LIAM: Okay, I start jogging backwards.;Part II
2035;2035;MARISHA;MARISHA: Took me down to 16 hit points.;Part II
2036;2036;LIAM;LIAM: Can I sneak attack while prone?;Part II
2037;2037;MATT;MATT: You're stealthed currently, so you would technically get a sneak attack, but you have to be in melee for you to get the other bonus. It would be sneak attack for this damage if you were to roll or if you were to throw a dagger at it, you would get the sneak attack.;Part II
2038;2038;LIAM;LIAM: Okay, so that means one throw instead of two?;Part II
2039;2039;MATT;MATT: You can throw both daggers at it.;Part II
2040;2040;LIAM;LIAM: All right. I feel so inspired by Scanlan's bardic tunes–;Part II
2041;2041;SAM;SAM: (singing) Yeah!;Part II
2042;2042;MATT;MATT: You can add it after you make the roll by the way.;Part II
2043;2043;LAURA;LAURA: If you do a really good roll then you don't need it.;Part II
2044;2044;LIAM;LIAM: Okay, 19 plus 11 is 30.;Part II
2045;2045;MATT;MATT: Because you're a rogue, isn't that critical for you?;Part II
2046;2046;LIAM;LIAM: Yeah. Oh, yeah.;Part II
2047;2047;MATT;MATT: Two criticals!;Part II
2048;2048;LIAM;LIAM: The other one, the other one is a 16 plus, plus– is a 26.;Part II
2049;2049;MATT;MATT: That also hits. You chuck both daggers out, they both arc around. You're used to throwing around–;Part II
2050;2050;LIAM;LIAM: I meant to say I was aiming at its eye, the main head's eye.;Part II
2051;2051;LAURA;LAURA: No, you should've said that first.;Part II
2052;2052;MATT;MATT: For flavor it's fine. Just go ahead, it's fine.;Part II
2053;2053;LIAM;LIAM: All right, four.;Part II
2054;2054;LAURA;LAURA: Four!;Part II
2055;2055;LIAM;LIAM: (counting)m 20. 20 times–is 40 plus four. 44, that's the first dagger?;Part II
2056;2056;MATT;MATT: Yeah, 44 damage.;Part II
2057;2057;LIAM;LIAM: 44.;Part II
2058;2058;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Damn!;Part II
2059;2059;MATT;MATT: Rogues, man.;Part II
2060;2060;MARISHA;MARISHA: Help me. Help!;Part II
2061;2061;LAURA;LAURA: That's just one dagger?;Part II
2062;2062;LIAM;LIAM: That's just one. Four plus two is six. Is that sneak attack? No.;Part II
2063;2063;MATT;MATT: No, only one sneak attack per turn.;Part II
2064;2064;LIAM;LIAM: Okay.;Part II
2065;2065;LAURA;LAURA: 40 and then six on the other one.;Part II
2066;2066;MATT;MATT: One actually hit one of the heads, one of the various naga heads directly into its face. As it does it goes through both eyes and you can see it begin reeling from the attack. It's looking pretty rough, actually. The stitches beginning to come apart at some of the seams and you can see a black ichorous liquid spill out from some of the suture marks.;Part II
2067;2067;LIAM;LIAM: Just a reminder the daggers, folks, blink back to the belt on my waist.;Part II
2068;2068;MATT;MATT: Because magic. Magic rogue shit. Keyleth, you're up.;Part II
2069;2069;LAURA;LAURA: Kill him!;Part II
2070;2070;MARISHA;MARISHA: Okay, so I'm really upset, really hurting. Out of anger I take my staff and I go (bam) and I crack and do Thunderwave pushing him back 15 feet.;Part II
2071;2071;MATT;MATT: All right. Makes the saving throw. He gets pushed back, so he takes damage, just half damage.;Part II
2072;2072;MARISHA;MARISHA: Okay, 2d8.;Part II
2073;2073;MATT;MATT: As you're setting up your gun it gets slammed right point blank to you.;Part II
2074;2074;MARISHA;MARISHA: Oh sorry. It takes four damage.;Part II
2075;2075;MATT;MATT: Four damage, all righty.;Part II
2076;2076;MARISHA;MARISHA: Then I'm going to turn into an eagle.;Part II
2077;2077;SAM;SAM: (laughs) As one does.;Part II
2078;2078;MATT;MATT: We'll say for that, because I forgot to bring an eagle, you're now a– (eagle sounds);Part II
2079;2079;MARISHA;MARISHA: And I fly away.;Part II
2080;2080;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Away.;Part II
2081;2081;(laughter);(laughter);Part II
2082;2082;MARISHA;MARISHA: Far, far, away.;Part II
2083;2083;ORION;ORION: Where are you going?!;Part II
2084;2084;SAM;SAM: Tell our story, Keyleth.;Part II
2085;2085;MATT;MATT: That's pretty great.;Part II
2086;2086;MARISHA;MARISHA: Then I cry in the corner and rock back and forth a little bit. That's my turn.;Part II
2087;2087;MATT;MATT: I forgot to mention you actually take half damage for the saving throw for the venom so you still would've taken 14 points of poison damage, so mark that.;Part II
2088;2088;ORION;ORION: Okay.;Part II
2089;2089;MATT;MATT: It is half damage on a save. That brings us to Scanlan.;Part II
2090;2090;SAM;SAM: Can I bonus inspire myself?;Part II
2091;2091;MATT;MATT: Because you're Scanlan I'll say, yes. You have such a high opinion of yourself that even you could inspire yourself. So yes, why not.;Part II
2092;2092;SAM;SAM: (singing) It would help me to acquire some dice to inspire. (speaking) I inspire myself first and move five feet back so I'm on the same row as him.;Part II
2093;2093;MATT;MATT: There?;Part II
2094;2094;SAM;SAM: Not that far.;Part II
2095;2095;MATT;MATT: There.;Part II
2096;2096;SAM;SAM: Yes. Them I'm going to cast Lightning Bolt at him.;Part II
2097;2097;MATT;MATT: Okay! Straight line that way?;Part II
2098;2098;SAM;SAM: Straight line, that way.;Part II
2099;2099;MATT;MATT: You don't have to roll to hit. You just roll damage on that. I make a saving throw.;Part II
2100;2100;SAM;SAM: Oh! I didn't even need to inspire.;Part II
2101;2101;MATT;MATT: What's your DC on the spell? Top of your spell list.;Part II
2102;2102;ORION;ORION: 17.;Part II
2103;2103;SAM;SAM: Thank you.;Part II
2104;2104;MATT;MATT: 17? That's a failure on its saving throw. Go ahead and roll 8d6.;Part II
2105;2105;LAURA;LAURA: 8d6?! Kill him!;Part II
2106;2106;MATT;MATT: Bards. Gets spells from other classes.;Part II
2107;2107;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: If you kill, I will take a shit on this table.;Part II
2108;2108;SAM;SAM: (counting);Part II
2109;2109;LIAM;LIAM: It's gone.;Part II
2110;2110;SAM;SAM: 24!;Part II
2111;2111;MATT;MATT: 24 points of lightning damage.;Part II
2112;2112;SAM;SAM: Yes. (sings a high-pitched note);Part II
2113;2113;MATT;MATT: How do you want to do this?;Part II
2114;2114;(yelling);(yelling);Part II
2115;2115;MARISHA;MARISHA: Wait! Is this the first time you've–;Part II
2116;2116;SAM;SAM: I've never killed anything before!;Part II
2117;2117;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Never killed anything in two years!;Part II
2118;2118;LIAM;LIAM: For the people at home, we live to hear Matt say:;Part II
2119;2119;ALL;ALL: “How do you want to do this?”;Part II
2120;2120;MATT;MATT: I let the player describe their victory. As you sing to yourself to bolster your arcane energy, you release a shear bolt of energy. How do you want to do this?;Part II
2121;2121;SAM;SAM: The bolt of lightning begins in its tail and works its way up through its spine, slowly but painfully torturing it as it slowly, slowly feels the effect coursing through its evil body.;Part II
2122;2122;MATT;MATT: Because of your bardic ability to actually shape sound from an arcane standpoint, a lightning bolt should be an instant flash of arcane energy, you actually cause it to crawl. You control it as it begins to cascade up the torso of this horrible abomination. As it does you can see the bolts splinter and destroy each suture wound as each of its heads begins to slough off the rest of the torso until nothing is left but the single head screaming into the air. As the bolt makes its way up the neck, its eyes burst out in a blast of energy. The body falls limp to the ground.;Part II
2123;2123;SAM;SAM: Can it have a lightning bolt shaped in an “S?”;Part II
2124;2124;MATT;MATT: A Scanlan-shaped lightning bolt is burned into the torso of the strange naga beast.;Part II
2125;2125;TRAVIS;TRAVIS: Well done, Scanlan, well done!;Part II
2126;2126;MATT;MATT: The dust settles, the adrenaline still pumping in your system, Scanlan. All the rest of the dwarves begin stepping down, putting their crossbows down, looking down at the little gnome that created a storm from its hands. One of them pats him on the shoulder and goes, “Well done.”;Part II
2127;2127;SAM;SAM: Thank you. Just promise me you'll that tell Pike about this.;Part II
2128;2128;MATT;MATT: “Okay?”;Part II
2129;2129;SAM;SAM: Because it was really cool, right?;Part II
2130;2130;MATT;MATT: “That was pretty cool.”;Part II
2131;2131;SAM;SAM: Okay, good.;Part II
2132;2132;MATT;MATT: All the dwarves look into the tunnel that it came from and the one that you spoke to earlier goes, “So that's the kind of thing that's been coming out of there.”;Part II
2133;2133;LAURA;LAURA: Lovely.;Part II
2134;2134;MARISHA;MARISHA: Thanks for the heads up.;Part II
2135;2135;TALIESIN;TALIESIN: That was really helpful.;Part II
2136;2136;MATT;MATT: We'll go ahead and leave the game there for the night.;Part II
2137;2137;(cheering);(cheering);Part II
2138;2138;MATT;MATT: Folks, well done. Hope you guys had fun watching our first ever Critical Role. That was a good time so we'll be here next week on Thursday. 7:00, though. Today was a special early edition because all of Geek & Sundry's going to South by Southwest.;Part II
2139;2139;ZAC;ZAC: Good job, dude!;Part II
2140;2140;MATT;MATT: Dude, thank you, Zac!;Part II
2141;2141;ZAC;ZAC: This is so much fun. This is the most fun I've had all week now until I die of stress behind the camera.;Part II
2142;2142;MATT;MATT: Good! That's good.;Part II
2143;2143;ZAC;ZAC: Guys, I hate to end it so abruptly but we're actually packing up the cameras that are filming me now, our unit, everything, lights, and getting on a plane and heading to South by Southwest. We may stream tomorrow, we may not, we're flying blind, we'll see what stuff looks like when we get there. Thank you guys so much and we'll be back next week, 7:00pm. Next week guys, it's going to be great.;Part II
2144;2144;MATT;MATT: Thank you all for coming!;Part II
